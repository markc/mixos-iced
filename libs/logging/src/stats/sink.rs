//! `StatsSink` trait + period-roll-up payload types (plan §3.4, §4.1).
//!
//! The trait is the v1 storage-backend seam (Codex round-14 MAJOR fix
//! in the plan): the recorder calls `record_period` once per roll-up
//! period with the (metric, label-set, value, delta) tuples that
//! changed; `flush` is the `LogHandle::shutdown()` durability barrier.
//! v2 backends (SQLite, indexd, direct-Prometheus) slot in by
//! implementing this trait without touching the recorder.
//!
//! The trait deliberately doesn't carry the in-memory recorder state
//! across the boundary — only the *period delta*, which is what every
//! v2 backend can serialize. Cross-process aggregation lives on
//! `snapshot_since` (default `Unsupported`); JSONL implements it by
//! scanning the log dir, others by querying their store directly.
//!
//! # Why `PeriodValue` mirrors `SeriesValue` but is distinct
//!
//! `SeriesValue` (in `types.rs`) is the *snapshot* shape — what a
//! reader returns at point-in-time. `PeriodValue` is the *roll-up*
//! shape — what the recorder writes once per period to disk-class
//! backends. The two coincide *shape*-wise today (both fan out
//! Counter/Gauge/Histogram identically), but the snapshot surface is
//! v1-frozen against future readers while the roll-up shape may grow
//! variants in lockstep with v2 sink backends (a v2 SQLite backend
//! may want raw observation arrays, for example). Splitting them now
//! keeps the wire-frozen `SeriesValue` from picking up backend-only
//! variants.
