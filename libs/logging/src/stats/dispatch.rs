//! Substrate-side handler for the `<svc>.stats.snapshot` Bus verb
//! (plan §4.2).
//!
//! This module is the **pure** half of the verb — it operates on an
//! already-parsed [`SnapshotRequest`] and returns either the snapshot
//! shape from `types.rs` (with sensitivity-correct label representation)
//! or a [`SnapshotError`] capturing the cap-required / parse-rejected
//! cases. The wire-side Bus-message parser + response serializer is
//! slice 5b's concern; keeping the dispatch logic Bus-agnostic means
//! the cap-gating contract — the load-bearing security piece — is
//! unit-testable without standing up a noded broker.
//!
//! # The cap-gating contract (plan §4.2)
//!
//! Three caps shape the verb's behavior:
//!
//! 1. **`stats.snapshot:<svc>`** (operator-class default) — required
//!    to call the verb at all. Enforcement happens at the wire layer
//!    (slice 5b) and is *not* this module's concern — it gates verb
//!    admission, not response shape. This module assumes the caller
//!    has cleared that bar.
//!
//! 2. **`stats.snapshot:raw-labels:<svc>`** (host-class default) —
//!    unlocks raw label values on `LabelSensitivity::Restricted`
//!    families. Without it, the response replaces every Restricted
//!    family's `SeriesLabels::Raw` with `SeriesLabels::Hash` (the
//!    same FxHash digest that appears in JSONL records and
//!    cardinality-drop warnings, so an operator can correlate
//!    across surfaces). Tracked here by [`SnapshotRequest::has_raw_labels_cap`].
//!
//! # The probe-oracle defense
//!
//! The plan calls out that a `labels?` filter that binds a key to a
//! literal value is a side-channel on a Restricted family: a caller
//! without the raw-labels cap could guess values and observe which
//! hashed responses come back. The dispatch enforces this gate
//! WITHOUT touching the live registry — the decision is made from
//! a classification view held under the classify read lock for the
//! duration of the call (compile-time bounded family names), so
//! timing on the gate cannot leak whether a Restricted family
//! currently has any matching series, AND concurrent `classify()`
//! calls cannot land a `Safe → Restricted` reclassification between
//! the audit and the recorder snapshot. (Codex slice-5a round-2
//! MAJOR — round-1 cloned the map and released the lock, which left
//! the reclassification window open.)
//!
//! Concretely, a [`LabelFilter::KeyEquals`] without
//! `has_raw_labels_cap` is **rejected unless** the request's
//! [`MetricPattern`] is `Exact(name)` AND the classification view
//! resolves `name` to `Safe`. Prefix / Suffix globs and the no-glob
//! case both potentially admit unclassified (= default Restricted)
//! families, so a conservative reject is the only way to keep the
//! cap-gate independent of the live registry. (Codex slice-5a
//! round-1 BLOCKERs + MAJOR fix.)
//!
//! [`LabelFilter::HasKey`] (key-presence only, no value bind) is
//! permitted on Restricted families at the operator-class cap because
//! key names are bounded by compile-time metric definitions and carry
//! no user-controlled bytes (plan §4.2).
//!
//! [`labels_hash?`](SnapshotRequest::labels_hash) filters accept the
//! canonical 16-hex-char FxHash strings produced by
//! [`crate::stats::labels_hash`] and need no cap upgrade — the hash is
//! the redacted form already shipped on disk.
//!
//! # What is intentionally NOT here
//!
//! The 1 MB response-size cap (plan §4.2) lives at the wire layer —
//! this module returns the structured `Snapshot`; size enforcement
//! requires the serialized JSON bytes and lives in the Bus-response
//! serializer in slice 5b. Same for the `metric?`/`labels?` /
//! `labels_hash?` *string parser* — only the parsed enum form crosses
//! into this module.
