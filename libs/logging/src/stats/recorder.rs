//! `StatsRecorder` — the substrate's `metrics::Recorder` impl
//! (plan §3.3.1, §3.4).
//!
//! Composes `metrics_util::Registry<Key, AtomicStorage>` for atomic
//! counter/gauge/histogram storage, layered with per-metric
//! cardinality enforcement (plan §3.2 + §3.3.1 guardrails).
//!
//! # Cardinality discipline
//!
//! Every `register_*` callsite computes the canonical 64-bit FxHash
//! `id` of the label-set (the same hash family used for the wire
//! `labels_hash` digest in `labels_hash.rs`) and checks it against a
//! per-metric `HashSet<u64>`. If the metric's set already contains the
//! id, the call proceeds. If the set is full (size == cap), the call
//! returns a `Counter/Gauge/Histogram::noop()` handle — the caller
//! continues to operate on a no-op handle for the lifetime of that
//! label-set, and the built-in
//! `mixos_stats_cardinality_drops_total{metric=<name>}` counter is
//! incremented so the drop is observable. New label-sets are silently
//! dropped instead of raising because the hot path cannot tolerate
//! `Result<Counter, _>` propagation (per §3.2 design rationale).
//!
//! # Cap bounds (plan §3.3.1)
//!
//! - Floor: 16  (lower would lose information faster than it bounds memory)
//! - Ceiling: 4096  (caps recorder memory at ~few-MB per metric family even pathological)
//! - Default: 1024
//!
//! Out-of-bounds caps passed to the builder panic at build time — this
//! is operator/test-runtime misconfiguration, not a runtime input;
//! failing loudly at startup is the right shape.
//!
//! # Recursion guard on the drops metric
//!
//! `mixos_stats_cardinality_drops_total` is itself a metric family
//! tracked in the same cardinality registry. If its own cap is hit
//! (would require >cap distinct metric names dropping in a single
//! process, already gross misuse), `record_drop` degrades to a silent
//! no-op rather than recursing into itself.
