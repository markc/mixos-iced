//! Label-sensitivity classification registry (plan §3.3.2).
//!
//! Each metric family declares its `LabelSensitivity` at startup via
//! [`classify`]. The recorder, JSONL writer, and Bus snapshot verb
//! consult [`sensitivity_of`] to decide whether to write raw label
//! values or the hashed form.
//!
//! # Defaults are deliberately strict
//!
//! Unclassified families resolve to `Restricted` — the safer side.
//! The plan calls this out: under-restriction means user-controlled
//! bytes silently flow into every shipping pipeline the substrate
//! enables (Loki, Prometheus); over-restriction means an operator
//! sees `labels_hash` on a family that should have been `Safe` and
//! reclassifies it with one line of code.
//!
//! # Late re-classification is intentionally allowed
//!
//! P6 (`mix`) and P7 (daemon migration) call
//! `classify(name, Safe)` from `init_main`-equivalent paths *after*
//! the recorder is constructed but *before* any record is written.
//! Re-classifying a family after records have been written is not
//! a logic error here — the registry just publishes the new value;
//! sink correctness depends on call ordering, which is enforced at
//! the binary's init point, not by this module. The recorder logs a
//! `warn` event when a family is re-classified after the first
//! record is written (see slice 2b); the registry itself is permissive.
