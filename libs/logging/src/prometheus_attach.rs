//! `LogHandle::attach_prometheus` backing module (plan §8.1).
//!
//! Builds a `PrometheusRecorder` + `ExporterFuture` from
//! `PrometheusBuilder::with_http_listener(addr).build()`, wraps the
//! recorder in the redaction-first [`PrometheusChild`] shim, slots
//! it into the already-installed substrate `StatsRecorder` via
//! `set_prometheus_child_on_installed`, and spawns the exporter
//! future on the caller's Tokio runtime. `PrometheusBuilder::install`
//! is deliberately *not* used — it would try to take the global
//! `metrics::Recorder` slot the substrate `StatsRecorder` already
//! owns, defeating the redaction-first policy facade.

/// fails for a period, the recorder side map drops the entry (so
/// JSONL/Bus correctly emit no record), but a previously-registered
/// gauge in the Prometheus registry would otherwise keep rendering
/// its last value indefinitely (`idle_timeout` defaults to `None` in
/// `PrometheusBuilder::new`). Setting an idle timeout scoped to
/// `Gauge` causes the exporter to evict gauges that have not been
/// `set` for the timeout window, restoring the "series went dark"
/// semantic on `/metrics`.
///
/// Codex round-5 MAJOR: the timeout must be larger than the longest
/// allowed `stats.interval_seconds`, otherwise a successful rollup at
/// a high-interval setting cannot refresh the gauge before the
/// exporter declares it idle (a false-dark regression). The timeout
/// is derived from [`crate::stats::INTERVAL_SECONDS_CEILING`] as
/// `2× CEILING + 60 s` (jitter buffer for rollup-loop scheduling
/// skew and sink fanout under load), so bumping the ceiling
/// propagates here automatically — there is no second constant to
/// keep aligned. Both the substrate `before_set` and the
/// `init::install_stats_recorder` CLI/defaults path enforce the
/// matching upper bound on `interval_seconds` so this exporter never
/// sees a cadence it cannot survive.
///
/// Counter and histogram metrics are deliberately excluded from the
/// mask: a counter whose increments stop is *not* stale, its last
/// total is still the correct cumulative value.
