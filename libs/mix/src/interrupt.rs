//! Process-wide SIGINT cooperation for blocking Mix builtins.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Every Mix entry point (`mix-shell` REPL, runner, future embedders)
//! constructs a tokio current-thread runtime and runs the evaluator on
//! it. The evaluator owns an `Arc<AtomicBool>` interrupt flag that
//! statement-level evaluation polls at expression boundaries — pressing
//! Ctrl-C sets it, and the next poll converts it into a Mix runtime
//! error that unwinds the script.
//!
//! That works while the runtime is being polled. It does NOT work while
//! a *blocking* builtin like `ssh_run` is sitting inside `Command`'s
//! synchronous `try_wait()` / `wait_with_output()` — under a
//! current-thread runtime, the `tokio::signal::ctrl_c()` future cannot
//! make progress until control returns to the runtime. The flag is
//! never set, so the builtin's poll loop sees a steady `false` and the
//! user's Ctrl-C is silently swallowed until the child exits naturally.
//!
//! The fix is to install a process-level signal handler that runs in
//! signal context (independent of any runtime) and stores `true` into
//! the same `Arc<AtomicBool>` the evaluator already polls. The blocking
//! builtin reads the flag through the static `INTERRUPT_FLAG` published
//! here and treats absence (no host has wired anything) as "no
//! cooperation available, behave as before."
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//!
//! 1. The host (REPL, runner, library embedder) constructs an
//!    `Evaluator` and calls [`init`] with `eval.interrupt_flag()`.
//! 2. [`init`] publishes the flag into [`INTERRUPT_FLAG`] and registers
//!    a `signal-hook` SIGINT handler bound to the *same* `Arc`. If
//!    publication fails because some earlier caller already published a
//!    different flag, no handler is registered — guaranteeing that the
//!    handler always writes into exactly the flag that builtins read
//!    from.
//! 3. The handler stays registered for the rest of the process; there
//!    is no `deinit`. Re-using one flag across re-entries is the
//!    intended behaviour.
//!
//! ## Coexistence with tokio's `ctrl_c`
//!
//! `signal-hook` and tokio install their SIGINT receivers via
//! `signal_hook_registry`-compatible mechanisms, which chain handlers
//! in registration order. Both fire on each SIGINT: ours stores into
//! the flag; tokio's wakes the `ctrl_c()` future so the script-mode
//! `tokio::select!` race in `mix-shell/src/main.rs` still sees it.

/// Single-shot: the first successful call publishes the flag and

/// different one) returns `false` and registers nothing. This trades
/// the convenience of "re-init does the right thing" for the safety
/// guarantee that the handler is always bound to the flag builtins
/// read from — there is no path that registers a handler against a
/// flag that won't be polled.

/// handler), `false` if the flag was already published.
pub fn init(flag: Arc<AtomicBool>) -> bool {
    // `set` returns Err(_) if the cell is already initialized. We hand
    // it `flag.clone()` so the original `Arc` (owned by the caller's
    // evaluator) is unaffected by the publication outcome.
    if INTERRUPT_FLAG.set(flag.clone()).is_err() {
        return false;
    }
    // signal-hook stores `true` into the supplied AtomicBool from a
    // signal handler. The work it performs is async-signal-safe by
    // construction; we don't add any other code in the handler path.
    //
    // Errors here are exceptional (out of FDs, SIGINT permanently
    // blocked, etc.) and we deliberately swallow them — without the
    // handler the flag still works for the explicit-set path used by
    // the REPL's tokio task, and the pre-existing "blocking builtin
    // cannot be interrupted" behaviour is what we'd fall back to.
    // ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. signal_hook runs chained handlers in registration
    // order, and the evaluator polls the flag from a different thread, on a
    // different core, while the handler runs. Registering the flag first leaves
    // a window in which the interrupt is already visible but the mapping saying
    // WHICH evaluation it belongs to is not — and an evaluation that polls in
    // that window is interrupted with no cancellation intent recorded against
    // it. That race was observed, not theorised. Recording the mapping first
    // means any reader that sees the flag has already seen the mapping.
    //
    // SAFETY: `cancel::signal_arrived` performs two relaxed atomic stores and
    // nothing else — no allocation, no locking, no reentrant libc — which is
    // async-signal-safe.
    // A failure here is not cosmetic: without the mapping, cancellation cannot
    // tell which evaluation a SIGINT belongs to, so it degrades to the old
    // whole-process behaviour. Say so rather than swallowing it — a silently
    // half-installed cancellation contract is worse than none, because
    // everything downstream still reports as though it were whole.
