//! Per-evaluation cancellation (P0-J J-8).
//!
//! [`interrupt`](crate::interrupt) owns ONE process-wide flag because every
//! blocking builtin reads it through `INTERRUPT_FLAG`, and that single flag is
//! exactly why `set_interrupt_flag()` per request cannot express cancellation:
//! swapping the evaluator's flag leaves the builtins reading the first one ever
//! published, and raising the shared flag for a request that arrived late kills
//! whichever evaluation happens to be running instead of the one addressed.
//!
//! This module keeps the single shared flag as the delivery mechanism and adds
//! the missing half — an immutable per-evaluation identity with a STICKY
//! cancellation intent, and a signal-safe mapping of SIGINT onto the evaluation
//! that was active when the signal arrived:
//!
//! * [`begin`] opens an evaluation, publishes its id as the active one, and
//!   discards a signal aimed at anything else. A SIGINT delivered at an idle
//!   prompt therefore cannot trip the next evaluation.
//! * [`cancel`] resolves the exact id. An id that has already finished reports
//!   the real outcome and raises nothing, so a late request can never reach a
//!   successor evaluation.
//! * [`reassert`] re-raises the shared flag while intent is still set. The
//!   evaluator CLEARS the flag as it converts it into an error, so without this
//!   a Mix `try`/`catch` around cancelled work would swallow the intent and run
//!   on. A caught interruption must not clear cancellation intent.
//!
//! What this cannot do is documented rather than papered over: pre-emption is
//! cooperative at the evaluator's existing checkpoints and at whatever polling
//! a captured runner already performs. A builtin blocked in a synchronous
//! syscall is not interrupted by any of this, and the guarantee table in
//! `docs/mix/` says so.
