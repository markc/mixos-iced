In an `ssh_mix` body whose opts cannot be read statically, variable checks stand down — dynamic `bindings`/`env` may supply any data name (reported once per call as MIX-D3018) — and a read one edit away from a name the body DOES bind gets MIX-D3017 instead of silence.

A deleted legacy name (e.g. `grep`) gets this AND its MIX-D30xx rename pointer. The hint carries the same \"did you mean\" the runtime prints for that name (one shared suggester): deleted-name pointers first, then the foreign get/set/find FORM table (`get` → `$m[key]` / `get_or`/`require_key`; `set` → `$m[key] = value`; `find` → `index_of`/`filter`), then a foreign-name synonym table (`json_decode`/`json_loads` → `json_parse`, `str` → `to_string`, `trim_end`/`rstrip` → `rtrim`, `len_bytes` → `byte_length`, …), then edit distance — so `json_decode` suggests `json_parse`, not its nearest-spelled opposite `json_encode`.

The fleet refuted that theory: two sites across 785 scripts and neither was a shim — one a hand-rolled `ends_with` duplicating the builtin, the other an `fn mix_version()` in a pre-commit hook written to report a NAMED interpreter's version and silently answering with the running one's, a live wrong answer that sat behind a warning for sixteen releases. Lint is also the only gate an `ssh_mix` body passes through, and a warning stops nothing by default. The RUNTIME is unchanged — the builtin still wins; the fix is to rename. Since 0.91.0 \"builtin\" includes the evaluator's inline forms outside the builtin table's dispatch gate — `serve_name`, `printf`, the Bus forms `quit`/`reply`/`subscribe`/… — which win over a same-named function just the same and used to slip past this check.

Compare explicitly (`index_of(..) >= 0`), or use `contains()` for the yes/no question — EXCEPT for `bytes_find`, whose bytes/buffer subject `contains()` rejects, so a `bytes_find` finding takes the `>= 0` comparison, not `contains()`. The 1-based twins `pos`/`lastpos`/`byte_pos`/`byte_lastpos` are safe here (not-found sentinel is `0`, falsy) — that asymmetry is exactly the trap.

The heredoc twin is MIX-W2402. Does not fire for `${NAME}`, an escaped `\\$NAME`, a single-quoted `'…'` string, all-digit positionals like `$1`, a `$` followed by anything that is not an identifier (`\"$5.00\"`), or a name bound nowhere — `\"Total: $USD\"` in prose stays silent. The lexer also drops the whole batch for a MULTI-LINE string and for one whose spelling contains `\\\"`: both are the mark of NESTED source (an `ssh_mix` body, a `mix -c` program, a test fixture), where a bare `$rc` is the inner program's variable and correctly literal. Severity `note`, where the heredoc twin is a warning, and the asymmetry is measured: over 785 fleet scripts MIX-W2402 costs 4 findings and this rule an order of magnitude more even after those exclusions, so shipping it as a warning would fail `--deny-warnings` — a live fleet deploy gate — on scripts that are not wrong. D3xxx is the severity-independent namespace precisely so it can be promoted, code unchanged, once the residue is worked off.

Known false positive, Wontfix: a library under an absolute `/…/bin/…` path with no `lib` component; the mirror, any `/…/lib/…` or tests ancestor, exempts everything beneath it. A header whose value is not `X.Y.Z` (optionally `-pre` / `+build`) is reported on its own line, because the runtime treats it as absent and a typo would otherwise pass silently. Only one spelling counts: `-- version: X.Y.Z` (whitespace-tolerant, lowercase, colon required). Severity `note` by default; `mix lint --require-version` reports it as a `warning` with the code unchanged, so `--require-version --deny-warnings` makes a missing header fail a gate.

The boundary is split, not blanket: a function name cannot ride in through strict-data bindings, so undefined-FUNCTION checks (MIX-E1102) and arity checks (MIX-E1202) keep running, and a read one edit from a bound name gets MIX-D3017.

Use `replace_must()` / `re_replace_must()` (0.90.0), which raise `NEEDLE_ABSENT`, and whose `{count: n}` also asserts how many sites were rewritten. Conservative by design: it fires only on a `write_file` whose written value is a replace call or a variable the same straight-line block assigned from one, and ANY guard spelling anywhere in the file (`contains`, `pos`, `index_of`, `count_of`, `re_match`, a `_must` twin) silences it for the whole file.",
