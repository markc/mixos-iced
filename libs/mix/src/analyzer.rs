//! Semantic analyzer — the engine behind `mix lint` (0.29.0, decision
//! record D3).
//!
//! Sits between parse and evaluate, usable by embedders independently
//! of the CLI. Diagnoses the defect classes that `mix --check` (syntax
//! only) let through in the CT-provisioning worker: definitely
//! undefined variables, undefined callables, builtin/user-function
//! arity mismatches, duplicate parameters/definitions, unreachable
//! statements, discarded must-use results, and statically resolvable
//! `require()` failures — plus a capability inventory of the script.
//!
//! Design bias: **false positives near zero**. Mix is dynamic
//! (`source`/`include` load code at runtime, `${...}` interpolation
//! falls back to the process environment, blocks don't scope, bareword
//! calls can resolve to function-valued variables), so every rule is
//! deliberately conservative:
//!
//! - A variable read is flagged ONLY when the name is assigned nowhere
//!   in its visible universe (function body + file top level for
//!   function code; the whole file for top-level code) — lexical order
//!   is NOT considered, matching "no block scoping, globals visible
//!   from functions".
//! - `${name}` interpolation is never flagged (env fallback).
//! - All-digit names (`$1`...) and the runtime-injected `rc`/`result`/
//!   `status`/`event`/`_` are always declared.
//! - A `source`/`include` anywhere suppresses the undefined checks
//!   entirely (still reported once as MIX-W2401) — the loaded file can
//!   define anything.
//! - A bareword call whose name matches ANY assigned variable is not
//!   flagged (function-valued-variable dispatch).
//! - Calls inside `address ... end` blocks are sends, never undefined.
//! - `MethodCall`/`ValueCall` are dynamic dispatch — skipped.

/// definition can never be called. The worst shape of failure this produces
/// is a script that keeps running while its own function quietly stops
/// being called — every release that adds a builtin name arms it again
/// (print_raw, bytes_find, sprintf… were all plausible names for older
/// scripts to have defined).
///
/// PROMOTED TO AN ERROR in 0.90.0, and the 0.74.0 case for keeping it a
/// warning — "a compat shim written for an older mix is legitimate
/// authoring" — did not survive contact with the fleet. Two sites existed
/// across 785 scripts and NEITHER was a shim: one was a hand-rolled
/// `ends_with` duplicating the builtin (dead, harmless), and the other was
/// `fn mix_version()` in a pre-commit hook, written to report the version
/// of a NAMED interpreter and silently answering with the running one's
/// instead — a live wrong answer that had sat behind a warning for
/// sixteen releases. Lint is also the only gate an `ssh_mix` body ever
/// passes through, and a warning does not stop anything by default.
///
/// The RUNTIME is deliberately unchanged: the builtin still wins. Letting
/// the user definition win would flip the behaviour of every existing
/// shadowing script silently, which is the exact failure mode being
/// removed here — the fix is to rename, and now the tool says so in a way
/// that stops the run.
///
/// The code MOVED rather than changing severity in place: a code's letter
/// encodes its severity permanently (`MIX-W2xxx` are warnings that were
/// BORN warnings), so W2403 is retired, never reused, and its `mix explain`
/// entry points here.
///
/// The name set is `is_builtin` PLUS the evaluator's inline special forms
/// (0.91.0). `is_builtin` deliberately excludes the evaluator-special names
/// (`printf`, `serve_name`, …) and never knew the Bus forms (`quit`,
/// `reply`, `subscribe`, …) at all, yet the `FunctionCall` eval arm
/// dispatches each of them before any user-function lookup — `fn quit() return 1 end;

// ── MIX-D3xxx — deprecations and release-transition advisories ───────
//
// All emitted at `Severity::Note` in release A (0.63.0): visible in
// every lint run, never gating. The five regex/grep codes D3001–D3005
// promote to `Warning` in release A.1 (codes unchanged) once the fleet
// inventory reads zero, and the names are deleted in release B. The
// pos-family codes D3008–D3011 stay notes until THEIR count reads zero,
// whenever that is.
//
// D3006/D3007 were the release-transition watch notes for the A.1
// behaviour flips (map two-var binding; map/list `==` raising). Both
// flips SHIPPED in 0.68.0 and the notes are RETIRED — a watch note whose
// flip has landed is worse than no note, because it describes a future
// that is now the present. Their codes are permanently spent and must
// never be reused: a log or a script matching "MIX-D3006" means the
// pre-0.68.0 world, and reusing the number would make that match lie.
// Static, analyzer-surface only — never emitted at
// runtime (the `done`/`next` runtime-warning path is the anti-pattern:
// it would print on every execution of ~800 live call sites).
//
// Coverage: every spelling. A member-call of a BUILTIN name desugars to
// a FunctionCall at parse time (parser.rs `method_desugars_to_ufcs`),
// so `$s.regex_match(..)` is seen exactly like the bare call — pinned
// by the lint_notes CLI tests.

/// Pattern-first regex/grep names → their subject-first 0.63.0 twins.
/// ONE table, shared with the runtime: the evaluator's FUNCTION_UNDEFINED
/// handler reads it too, so a deleted name gets the same "use X instead"
/// pointer at runtime (where the straggler actually surfaces) that lint
/// gives at authoring time. (name, D-code, replacement-call).

///
/// That is not a theoretical gap. `deploy_vhost.mix:283` is a two-variable

/// rather than break it, but the gate was measured over a corpus that
/// structurally excluded exactly the code deploy scripts verify with.
///
/// TWO RULES, and the second matters more than the first:
///
/// 1. A **literal** body is parsed and analysed, and its diagnostics are
///    reported against the enclosing file at mapped line numbers. Literal
///    means a plain string, an all-literal heredoc (inline, as the manual's
///    headline idiom writes it), or a variable whose SOLE binding anywhere
///    in the file is one of those (see [`sole_string_definitions`]).
/// 2. A **non-literal** body — any other variable, a concatenation, a
///    `read_file`, a `${…}` interpolation — cannot be analysed, and is
///    REPORTED as unanalysable (MIX-D3012) rather than passing silently. An
///    invisible gap counted as clean is what produced the 0.68.0 near-miss;
///    a visible one is worth more than the analysis it replaces.
///
/// NAME RESOLUTION inside the body runs against the body itself, the
/// builtins, and the names the call injects — its `bindings` keys and its
/// `env` keys, both prepended to the shipped source as assignments. Those
/// are read statically from a map-literal opts argument, or from a
/// variable bound exactly once to one (the opts twin of the body's
/// `sole_string_definitions`). When they cannot be read (MIX-D3018), the
/// boundary is split, not blanket: dynamic bindings/env may supply any
/// free DATA variable, so undefined-VARIABLE checks stand down — but a
/// function name cannot ride in through strict-data bindings, so
/// undefined-FUNCTION checks keep running, and a variable read one edit
/// away from a name the body binds is reported as a typo-suspect note
/// (MIX-D3017) rather than skipped silently.
///
/// Every `ssh_mix` call is found, at any depth — the loop-over-hosts shape
