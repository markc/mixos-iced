//! Closed axes of the table key space.
//!
//! A family table is indexed by the product of several closed enums, so each
//! one has to supply four things that must agree exactly: the variants, an
//! iteration order (`ALL`), a table coordinate per variant (`index`), and an
//! authored name (`name`, which is also the wire spelling). Writing those out
//! by hand gives four places to edit and three ways to be silently wrong — a
//! coordinate that collides two cells, an `ALL` missing a variant so the axis
//! quietly shrinks, or a name that drifts from what the schema publishes.
//!
//! `closed_axis!` takes the list once and derives all four, which is why there
//! are no consistency assertions here: nothing can disagree with itself.
