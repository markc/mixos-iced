//! Supervised reconnecting Bus client (SPEC 18 §3.3).
//!
//! [`NodedClient`] is a one-shot dial: on transport loss its reader task
//! exits, the incoming receiver yields `None`, and any consumer (notably
//! the Mix event pump) sees a *terminal* close. That is correct for a
//! short-lived tool but fatal for a resident citizen — a single
//! `mixos-noded` bounce cleanly kills every Mix daemon. SPEC 18 §3.3
//! names this the one gating defect for "long-running".
//!
//! [`SupervisedClient`] wraps a [`NodedClient`] and owns the
//! `connect → register → (replay subs) → pump` loop:
//!
//! * **Initial connect** uses a *bounded* budget
//!   ([`MAX_INITIAL_ATTEMPTS`]) so a misconfigured citizen fails fast
//!   (SPEC 18 §3.1 — serve mode exits non-zero on a typed fatal).
//! * **Reconnect** is *unbounded* with exponential backoff + full
//!   jitter (base 250 ms, ×2, cap 30 s — DECIDED §7-Q1) so a resident
//!   citizen waits out a long broker outage without systemd flapping.
//! * On every reconnect the [`SubscriptionRegistry`] is replayed **in
//!   recorded order** (§3.3 — re-subscribe, not just re-register, is
//!   the real gate).
//! * The wrapper owns a **replaceable** incoming stream
//!   (consult BLOCKER 2): the outward [`mpsc::UnboundedReceiver`] handed
//!   to the Mix pump (WS3) survives reconnects; only a *fatal* shutdown
//!   closes it. A transient drop is never observed as the sticky
//!   terminal `"transport_closed"`.
//! * While disconnected, every outbound call **fails fast with a typed
//!   error** ([`SupervisedError::Disconnected`]) — there is **no
//!   outbound queue** (the forbidden partial-truth buffer).
//!
//! The [`SubscriptionRegistry`] is *mutated* by WS2's
//! `subscribe`/`unsubscribe` primitive (transactionally, only after an
//! RC-0 broker subscribe). WS1 only defines the structure and replays
//! it; until WS2 lands the registry stays empty and replay is a no-op,
//! but the machinery is exercised by the reconnect test.
