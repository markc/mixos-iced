//! Literal = `regex::escape`; `RegexBuilder` with `multi_line(true)`,
//! `case_insensitive(!case)`, `size_limit(REGEX_SIZE_LIMIT)`. Per match: `text`
//! truncated to `MATCH_TEXT_MAX` (`text_truncated`); groups only when requested,
//! each truncated likewise; the whole match's encoded size capped at
//! `MATCH_ENCODED_MAX` — the group list stops at the first group that would
//! pass it (later groups are omitted, not `null`) and `groups_truncated` is
//! set, so every page holds at least one match. The result stops at
//! `limit` or the caller's encoded budget with `truncated` and `next` (end of
//! the last returned match, or its start + 1 scalar for an empty match).
//! Bad regex → INVALID_ARGUMENT `bad_regex`.
