//! Op log, undo lanes, coalescing and retention (plan §3.5).
//!
//! # Contract: undo is preflighted, never rolled back (frozen)
//! `undo(L)`:
//! 1. Peek (do not pop) lane L's top group.
//! 2. For each member rev, newest → oldest: take its inverse RangeSet
//!    ([`crate::ot::invert`]) and transform it through EVERY log entry after
//!    that member (including the group's own later members), so every item ends
//!    in current-rev coordinates. Overlap → CONFLICT `undo_conflict` (context
//!    `intervening_rev`, `intervening_origin`). (E0a sharpening: an undo/redo
//!    entry in that window whose target entries are also in it cancels
//!    against them, the entries between being rewritten to exclude them —
//!    otherwise "edit, fix it, undo the fix, undo the edit" refuses, because
//!    the fix overlaps the edit's text although it was itself undone. See
//!    `Buffer::reduced_after`.)
//! 3. Union the items into one RangeSet in READING order. Two items
//!    overlapping under the §3.4 rule → `undo_conflict`. Equal-offset inserts
//!    keep list order. (E0a sharpening: the plan said "newest member first",
//!    which restores a run of backspaces correctly but REVERSES a run of
//!    forward deletes — both coalesce by the rule below. The composition in
//!    `Buffer::compose_inverse` orders a tie by where the newer member's edit
//!    lay relative to the older item when it applied, which is the original
//!    order in both cases.)
//! 4. Verify against the CURRENT text that each item's target range holds
//!    exactly the text it removes; mismatch → `undo_conflict`.
//! 5. Apply the union as ONE ordinary two-phase transaction, recorded as one
//!    entry `Undo { of: first..=last }`; anchors/selections map once.
//! 6. Only then pop the group and push the new entry's rev on `redo[L]`.
//!
//! A failed undo/redo: refusal only — no entry, no rev change, no event, no
//! anchor/selection change, stacks unchanged. Redo is the same over the Undo
//! entry's inverse.
//!
//! # Lanes and coalescing
//! A new `Edit` in lane L pushes a group, or with `coalesce: true` appends to
//! the top group when that group's last rev is `rev - 1`, same lane,
//! single-edit txn, contiguous with the previous insert (or delete). It clears
//! `redo[L]`. Groups are therefore contiguous rev ranges. Global `"*"` picks the
//! lane whose top group has the highest rev.
//!
//! # Retention
//! A contiguous suffix: newest `LOG_MAX_ENTRIES` entries or `LOG_MAX_TEXT_BYTES`
//! of stored text, whichever binds. Undo reach is exactly the retained suffix;
//! groups referencing trimmed revs are dropped. A trimming apply reports
//! `history_trimmed_to`.
//!
//! # op_id
//! The core records and echoes `op_id` only. Deduplication belongs to editd's
//! buffer actor, keyed `(caller_key, origin, verb, op_id)` BEFORE lane
//! selection, successes only (plan §3.5).
