//! Isolated supervised tasks (P4) — the second §5.2 execution mode.
//!
//! An interactive evaluation runs INSIDE the shell: it sees the shell's
//! variables, its directory and its terminal, and everything about its
//! cancellation is therefore cooperative. A task is the opposite by
//! construction: a separate process, in its own group, with an enumerated
//! environment, separate stdout and stderr pipes, and a hard termination
//! policy. That is why idle-prompt admission does NOT apply here — BUSY is
//! never a task refusal, and a task submitted while the human is typing runs
//! anyway. The independence is the whole point of the mode.
//!
//! This module owns spawn and supervision only. Identity, the capability gate,
//! the dedupe store and the operation-id space stay in `session_execute`, which
//! already has all four; a second owner would duplicate every one of them.
//!
//! ## What is guaranteed, and what is not
//!
//! Termination IS hard here, and it is the arc's only hard guarantee: cancel or
//! timeout sends SIGTERM to the group, waits a declared grace, then SIGKILL,
//! and the outcome is read from `wait()` rather than from the fact that a
//! signal was sent. A cancel request is not proof a process stopped; the wait
//! status is.
//!
//! Teardown has three mechanisms because none covers the others' cases.
//! `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` binds the task LEADER to the supervisor thread that
//! forked it, which is the only thing that survives a shell SIGKILL — no
//! teardown hook runs then. At SETTLEMENT the supervisor SIGKILLs the whole
//! group one last time, which is what reaches a child the task backgrounded and
//! pdeathsig cannot see. And `sweep()` SIGKILLs every still-running task group
//! when the shell exits by any ordinary route.
//!
//! The settlement kill is only possible because the leader is not reaped until
//! after it: a process group exists while any member does, including a zombie,
//! so holding the leader un-reaped (`waitid` with `WNOWAIT`) is what keeps the
//! group addressable long enough to clear it.
//!
//! The declared residual is therefore exactly one case: a process that leaves
//! the task's group by calling `setsid`/`setpgid` for ITSELF. That is a
//! deliberate act of daemonisation, and the manual says so rather than implying
//! a containment this does not have.
