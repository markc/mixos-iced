/// clears `ONLCR` itself, but it also never *repairs* it: if Mix is launched
/// with `OPOST`/`ONLCR` already off (a login shell inheriting a raw tty, or a
/// prior child that exited without restoring it), every external command's
/// LF-terminated output "staircases" — a bare `\n` moves the cursor down one
/// row without returning it to column 0, so each line marches rightward.

/// Mix owns exactly these two output bits while interactive and re-asserts
/// them on both stdout and stderr (each tty-guarded). Consequence (intentional,
/// tested): a `stty -onlcr` does not persist across prompts in interactive Mix
/// — Mix re-enables CR-NL output every cycle. Everything else — input flags,
/// local flags, erase/flow-control/signal characters — is left alone: rustyline
/// manages raw input per readline, and we don't clobber later `stty` changes to
/// unrelated settings. Best-effort: any failure just leaves the staircase, it
/// never disrupts the REPL. Called at REPL startup, at the top of each loop, and
