//! `--result-fd N` — the structured-value channel for an isolated task.
//!
//! An isolated task's whole purpose is exact capture, and the one thing pipes
//! cannot separate is "the program's text" from "the evaluation's value". Text
//! goes to stdout and stderr as it always has; the value travels its own
//! inherited descriptor, so a task that prints and a task that returns are not
//! competing for the same stream.
//!
//! The frame is a big-endian u32 length followed by exactly that many bytes,
//! matching the sealed-memfd idiom the S3 bootstrap already uses. A reader can
//! therefore tell three things apart that an unframed stream cannot:
//!
//! * nothing written at all — the process died before producing a value
//!   (`result_missing`),
//! * a length that the payload does not satisfy — the writer was killed
//!   mid-frame (`result_torn`),
//! * a complete frame carrying a `truncated` marker — the value was larger
//!   than the cap and says so.
//!
//! Without the prefix the first two are indistinguishable from each other and
//! from an empty result, which is precisely the ambiguity a task surface must
//! not have.
