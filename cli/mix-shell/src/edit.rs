//! `mix edit FILE OLD NEW` — the one-line exact-match file edit.
//!
//! ```text
//! mix edit [--all] [-n|--dry-run] FILE OLD NEW
//! ```
//!
//! This exists to remove the `sed -i` reflex. The reflex was never about
//! the language: a one-line edit *from a shell prompt* had no Mix shape
//! shorter than writing a `.mix` file, so an agent under time pressure
//! reached for `sed` — and `sed` is a regex engine that silently edits
//! every match, or none, and says nothing either way.
//!
//! So the contract here is the opposite of `sed`'s on every axis that
//! bit us:
//!
//! * **Exact match, never a pattern.** OLD is compared byte-for-byte.
//!   No metacharacters, no delimiter to choose, no escaping.
//! * **Refuses an ambiguous edit.** More than one occurrence and
//!   nothing is written — the run exits 2 and names every line that
//!   matched. `--all` is the explicit opt-in to edit them all.
//! * **Refuses a silent miss.** A needle that is not present exits 1
//!   with the file untouched. `sed`'s "0 substitutions, exit 0" is the
//!   failure mode that shipped three wrong files in one session.
//! * **Prints what it did.** The changed line(s) as a `-`/`+` pair, so
//!   the caller sees the edit without a second `read_file`.
//!
//! Exit codes: 0 = edited; 1 = OLD absent, file untouched; 2 = OLD
//! ambiguous (>1 occurrence without `--all`), file untouched; 3 = usage
//! error, or the file could not be read or written.
//!
//! The write is atomic: a sibling temp file is written, fsynced, and
//! renamed over the original, carrying the original's permission bits.
//! An interrupted `mix edit` therefore leaves the old file intact
//! rather than a truncated one.
//!
//! In a script the nearest equivalent is `replace()` — but note it is
//! SILENT when the needle is absent, returning the input unchanged, so
//! a script doing this has to check for itself.

/// window from the whole run to the syscall gap and turns the common
/// case — a concurrent edit, an editor save — into a refusal instead of
