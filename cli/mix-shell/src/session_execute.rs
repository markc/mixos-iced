//! Idle-prompt execution admission on the enrolled attachment (P0-J stage D).
//!
//! This is the half of BROKER-023's `execute` that lives in the SHELL. Holding
//! the capability never implied the shell could run anything; until this module
//! existed the answer was UNSUPPORTED on both sides.
//!
//! The sequence is the design memo's, and each step is here for a reason a
//! shorter one would violate:
//!
//! 1. The Bus arm validates schema, bounds and authority, and submits a
//!    candidate naming the prompt generation it believes is current.
//! 2. The admission owner reserves the eligible prompt. A reservation is NOT an
//!    acceptance: it only asks the editor to give up the terminal.
//! 3. The editor processes already-observed human activity FIRST, then either
//!    refuses (BUSY, having discarded nothing) or acknowledges the release with
//!    the prompt and edit revision it released at.
//! 4. The owner rechecks identity, lease deadline, generation and edit state.
//!    The editor round trip is a delay, and everything checked before it may
//!    have changed during it.
//! 5. The prompt generation is consumed and the acceptance recorded, atomically,
//!    on the thread that owns the editor.
//! 6. With reads stopped and cooked mode restored, the principal and command id
//!    are VISIBLY echoed, then the line executes down the same dispatch path a
//!    human line takes.
//! 7. The shell reclaims the terminal, builds the next prompt and restarts
//!    editing explicitly. There is no speculative readline.
//!
//! Admission is empty-primary-prompt only (Mark, ADR 2026-09-11). A half-typed
//! line, a history search, a paste in progress or a continuation prompt returns
//! BUSY and discards nothing. Nothing executes underneath a human draft.
//!
//! The surface exists only under the owned editor. The rustyline path cannot
//! release the terminal without a keypress, so it answers UNSUPPORTED — a
//! declared limitation, never BUSY.
