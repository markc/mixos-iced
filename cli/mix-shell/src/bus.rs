    // SPEC 18 WS2 — Ch03 topic (un)subscription.
    //
    // This `MixBusHandler` owns a bare anonymous `NodedClient`
    // (transient `mix <script>` mode): it issues the
    // `topic.subscribe`/`topic.unsubscribe` RPC and there is **no**
    // `SubscriptionRegistry` because there is no supervisor — a
    // transient citizen has nothing to replay (no reconnect path; the
    // process is gone if the broker bounces). Anonymous connections
    // still have full topic pub/sub via the Ch03 §3.11.1
    // connection-scoped synthetic peer identity, so the broker accepts
    // these.
    //
    // The registry-aware transactional chokepoint is
    // `::bus::native_client::SupervisedClient::{subscribe,unsubscribe}_topic`.
    // **WS3 wires serve mode's `MixBusHandler` to the supervised client
    // so `subscribe()` from init-body or handler-body mutates that one
    // shared registry** (the §3.3 replay guarantee proven at the
    // mixos-lib-client layer in WS2's tests). Until then this transient
    // path is correct precisely because it has no registry to keep
    // honest. The `name` header carries the topic (the broker's
    // `topic.subscribe` requires it; empty body forces header routing).
