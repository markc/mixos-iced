//! `kill(false)` must raise, tested OUT OF PROCESS (0.52.0).
//!
//! This case lives here rather than beside the other kill tests in
//! mix because of what it does when the fix is *absent*. Before
//! 0.52.0, `to_number(false)` was `0.0`, so `kill(false)` became
//! `kill(0, SIGTERM)` — a signal to every process in the caller's process
//! group. Running that in-process means the test runner signals itself: during
//! development the mutation check (revert the fix, confirm the test fails) took
//! the whole harness down with exit 144, killed by its own SIGTERM, instead of
//! reporting a failed assertion.
//!
//! A child process absorbs that blast. The assertion is identical; only the
//! blast radius changes, so a future reverter gets a red test rather than a
//! dead runner.
