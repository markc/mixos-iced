//! `mix -c` must run a program whose FIRST line is a comment.
//!
//! It did not: both the no-op guard in `main.rs` and the classifier in
//! `shell.rs` tested `trimmed.starts_with("--")`, which is correct for a REPL
//! line (the input IS one line) but wrong for `-c`, which carries whole
//! programs. A program opening with a comment was classified Empty, silently
//! discarded, and reported exit 0.
//!
//! Silent discard reporting success is the worst available failure shape: a
//! script that never ran is indistinguishable from one that ran and did
//! nothing. Comments are the normal way to open a generated script, so this hit
//! machine-authored code squarely.
//!
//! Both directions are pinned here — the bug case must RUN, and a genuinely
//! all-comment input must still be a clean no-op. Fixing only the first would
//! turn every stray comment line into a parse error.
