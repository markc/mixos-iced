//! `mix man gotchas` is executable, not prose.
//!
//! The gotchas page exists because Mix has almost no training-data
//! presence and a model's first guess is often silently wrong. A page
//! of confident claims about a language nobody can autocomplete is
//! exactly the thing that rots into confident fiction — so every row of
//! its table is run here through the real binary and compared to the
//! stated result.
//!
//! The table's contract, parsed below:
//!
//! ```text
//! | you will guess | Mix is | probe | prints |
//! ```
//!
//! * **probe** — Mix source, backticked, run as `mix -c <probe>`.
//! * **prints** — backticked. Plain text must equal the probe's trimmed
//!   stdout. A leading `!` means the probe must FAIL, with that text
//!   appearing in stderr.
//!
//! A row that stops being true fails the build. A page that loses its
//! table, or its rows, fails too — a doctest that silently checks
//! nothing is worse than no doctest, because it reads as coverage.
//!
//! **A probe must be deterministic in ANY environment this suite runs
//! in.** In particular it must not depend on which Bus services happen
//! to be registered: a row that sent to `comp-nested` printed `string`
//! on a build worker and would have printed `map` on the days the
//! nested compositor was running, turning the page red for a reason
//! that had nothing to do with the page. Send probes name a service
//! that can never exist.
