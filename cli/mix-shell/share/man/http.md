# http — HTTP client builtins

## Streaming file download (0.97.0)

`http_get_file(url, path[, opts]) -> map<http_file_response>` streams GET to a
unique sibling created exclusively. For a new destination it uses mode 0666
under the process umask, matching `write_atomic`. When the destination exists,
staging starts at 0600, before any append prefix or incoming body is copied;
the target's permission bits are applied through the open descriptor only
after verification, just before publication. It hashes while writing,
syncs the completed file, publishes atomically, then syncs the directory.
The parent directory must exist. Defaults refuse an existing destination:
Linux uses `renameat2(RENAME_NOREPLACE)`, with atomic hard-link creation as
the fallback. Unsupported filesystems fail; there is no check-then-rename
fallback. `overwrite: true` permits atomic replacement of a regular file,
preserving its current permission bits. Symlink replacement is refused.

Options are `overwrite`, `append`, `expect_blake3` (64 lowercase hex digits),
`max_bytes`, `headers`, and the upload timeout/TLS options below. Redirects
are returned. Only a 200 or 204 installs a fresh file. HTTP error bodies may
be returned in `body`/`bytes` (64 MiB cap), but never become the destination.
Successful file bodies stay on disk; `body` is nil and `bytes` empty.
From 0.97.0, 200/206 downloads require identity framing with Content-Length.
Missing length or non-identity encoding returns status 0 with
`HTTP_IDENTITY_FRAMING` and leaves the destination untouched. This also rejects
ureq's transparent gzip decoding, which removes both Content-Encoding and
Content-Length. Chunked/close-delimited 200/206 bodies are deliberately refused;
blobd's lane supplies Content-Length. A body-free 204 remains supported.

`append: true` requires `expect_blake3` for the **whole final file** and an
existing regular prefix file. It copies and hashes the prefix into staging,
requests `Range: bytes=<prefix-size>-`, and accepts only a 206 with one
Content-Range starting at that size and ending at the representation's final
byte. An ignored Range, wrong range, short read or hash mismatch leaves the
prefix unchanged. Append and overwrite are mutually exclusive; append itself
authorises replacing the prefix after verification. Keep the destination
exclusive to this caller during append/overwrite. The builtin owns Range and
Accept-Encoding (requests identity); these headers cannot be overridden.

`max_bytes` applies to the final size, including the prefix, and defaults to
9007199254740991 (the exact integer limit). `bytes_written` counts downloaded
bytes written to staging; `size` includes the copied prefix. `blake3` is the
verified final digest, or nil on failure. The extra `published` boolean is
true once publication succeeds, including the rare status-0 directory-sync
failure after publication; callers must not interpret that failure as rollback.
All earlier failures remove staging and preserve the destination.

Operational failures return status 0 with `FILE_IO`, `FILE_EXISTS`,
`HTTP_RANGE`, `HTTP_HASH_MISMATCH`, `HTTP_SHORT_READ`, `HTTP_BODY_LIMIT`, or
the HTTP transport/body codes. Invalid options raise. Network and FsWrite
are unconditional; append:true or ca_file additionally requires FsRead.
The same socket inactivity and cooperative deadline limitations apply as for
uploads. Memory use for successful downloads stays bounded by a 64 KiB buffer.

## Streaming file upload (0.97.0)

`http_put_file(url, path[, opts]) -> map<http_file_response>` streams a regular
file with a fixed 64 KiB transfer buffer. Keep the source immutable during the
call. `range: {start, end}` selects inclusive byte offsets; without it the
whole file is sent, including an empty file. Content-Length is exact and an
early EOF fails with `HTTP_SHORT_READ`. Sizes and offsets must be exact Mix
integers (0 through 9007199254740991); invalid ranges raise `OPTION_INVALID`.

Options are `method` (`PUT`, `POST`, or `PATCH`, default `PUT`), `range`,
`headers`, `idle_timeout` (seconds, default 30, positive), `deadline` (seconds,
default 0 = disabled), `ssl_verify`, `ca_file`, and `ca_pem`. TLS options have
the same validation and trust roots as the buffered HTTP builtins below.
Unknown options raise. The builtin owns Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding;
setting either header raises. Redirects are disabled: a 3xx is returned.

`idle_timeout` bounds socket inactivity (and connection establishment).
`deadline` is checked cooperatively around streaming IO. It is best-effort
during blocking DNS/IO, **not a hard whole-call bound**. Both accept fractional
seconds, up to one year.

The distinct `http_file_response` has `status`, `headers`, `bytes_written`,
`size`, `blake3`, `body`, `bytes`, `final_url`, `duration_ms`, `error_code`, and
`error`, and `published` (false for uploads). For uploads, `bytes_written` counts source bytes consumed, not a
server's durable acknowledgement; `size` is the selected window size and
`blake3` is its lowercase digest (nil on failure). Response bodies are capped
at 64 MiB. Received HTTP responses retain their real status; IO/transport failures return
status 0 and an error (`FILE_IO`, `HTTP_SHORT_READ`, or the HTTP codes below).
Argument errors raise. Inspect the result even when the call does not raise.

A server can reject a large PUT/PATCH before consuming its body. If the socket
fails while ureq is still writing, the caller can receive status 0 and lose the
server's status and diagnostic body. For resumable blob uploads, recover via
HEAD and its durable offset/state rather than assuming the chunk was accepted.
Downloads refuse close-delimited 200/206 bodies without Content-Length, as
required by the identity-framing contract above.

Network **and FsRead are unconditional capabilities**, including calls without
options. Structured discovery and `mix lint` include both. The `http` Cargo
feature itself enables BLAKE3; `crypto` is not required for these transfers.

The HTTP client builtins — a small, blocking HTTP/1.1 client built on
[`ureq`](https://docs.rs/ureq). Three calls cover the whole surface:
`http_get`, `http_post`, and the any-verb `http_request`. They are
**feature-gated** (the `http` cargo feature) in `mixos-lib-mix`; the shipped
`mix` binary turns the feature on, so they are always present in the CLI. In
the builtin catalogue they list under the `system` category
(`mix builtins system`); one-line help for any name: `mix what http_get`.

```mix
$r = http_get("https://example.com")
print("status=" .. $r["status"])
print("body_len=" .. length($r["body"]))
```
```text
status=200
body_len=559
```

## The four calls

```
http_get(url, [headers], [{timeout, ssl_verify, ca_file, ca_pem}])                      -- GET
http_post(url, body, [headers], [{timeout, ssl_verify, ca_file, ca_pem}])               -- POST with a body
http_request(method, url, [body], [headers], [{timeout, ssl_verify, ca_file, ca_pem}])  -- any verb
http_post_multipart(url, fields, files, [headers], [opts])                              -- POST multipart/form-data
```

- `url` — a string (anything else is stringified via the usual coercion).
- `headers` — an optional **map** of header name → value (see [Headers](#headers)).
- `body` — a string (sent as UTF-8) or a `bytes` buffer (sent raw); see [Request bodies](#request-bodies).
- `fields` / `files` (`http_post_multipart` only, v0.103.12) — `fields` is a map of string form fields; `files` is a map of `field_name → {filename, content_type?, data: bytes|buffer}`. The multipart boundary is generated and the `Content-Type` header set accordingly — the generic webhook/file-upload slot, so a vendor upload is a script over this, never a core dependency (see [Request bodies](#request-bodies)).
- `method` (`http_request` only) — upper-cased internally, so `"get"`, `"Get"`, `"GET"` are equivalent. It must be a valid [RFC 7230](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230) token (no spaces / control bytes) or the call returns the error shape — this guards against request-line injection.
- `{timeout, ssl_verify, ca_file, ca_pem}` — an optional trailing **opts map**. `timeout` bounds the whole request (default 30 s, `{timeout: 0}` disables — see [Timeouts](#timeouts)). `ssl_verify` defaults to `true`; `ssl_verify: false` **skips TLS certificate and hostname verification** for that call (like `curl -k`) — see [Skipping TLS verification](#skipping-tls-verification).
- `ca_file` / `ca_pem` (v0.29.0) — trust a **private CA** for this call: `ca_file` reads PEM certificate(s) from a path, `ca_pem` takes them inline (string/bytes/buffer). The certificates are **ADDED to the default (Mozilla webpki) roots** — chain building and hostname verification still run in full, so this is the right way to talk to an internal endpoint with a proper private-CA-issued cert (the readiness-check case), unlike `ssl_verify: false` which proves nothing. Mutually exclusive with each other and with `ssl_verify: false`; input capped at 4 MiB; a missing/unreadable file, invalid PEM, or PEM with no certificates raises a catchable `HTTP_TLS` structured error (see [errors](errors.md)). In a capability-sandboxed embedder, `ca_file` additionally requires the `fs-read` class (declared as a conditional capability in the builtin metadata).

`http_get` takes 1–3 arguments, `http_post` 2–4, `http_request` 2–5. Too few
raises a runtime error, and — unlike the Mix-wide minimum-arity convention —
**too many also raises**, so a misplaced opts map can't be silently ignored
and leave a call unbounded:

```mix
http_get()
-- Runtime error at line 1: http_get() expects at least 1 argument(s), got 0
http_post("https://example.com")
-- Runtime error at line 1: http_post() expects at least 2 argument(s), got 1
http_get($url, {}, {}, {})
-- Runtime error at line 1: http_get() expects at most 3 argument(s), got 4
```

## The return shape

Every call resolves to one of two map shapes.

### Success / HTTP-error response

| key | type | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `status` | number | the HTTP status code (`200`, `404`, `503`, …) |
| `body` | string \| nil | the body **decoded as UTF-8**; `nil` when the bytes are not valid UTF-8 |
| `bytes` | bytes | the **raw** response byte buffer, always present |
| `headers` | map | response headers — **lowercase** names → **list** of string values (repeated fields preserved), e.g. `$r.headers["content-type"]` is `["text/html"]` (v0.30.0) |
| `final_url` | string | the URL after any redirects (v0.30.0) |
| `duration_ms` | number | wall-clock request duration (v0.30.0) |
| `error_code` | string \| nil | `nil` on any HTTP response (incl. 4xx/5xx); an `HTTP_*` code only on a transport failure (v0.30.0) |
| `error` | string \| nil | `nil` on an HTTP response; the message on a transport failure |

The `headers`/`final_url`/`duration_ms`/`error_code` keys are **additive** —
pre-0.30 scripts reading `status`/`body`/`bytes` are unaffected.

A **4xx / 5xx is a response, not a failure** — it carries the real code plus
whatever error payload the server sent, so REST callers can read both:

```mix
$r = http_get("https://example.com/does-not-exist-xyz")
print("status=" .. $r["status"])
print("body=" .. substr($r["body"], 0, 40))
```
```text
status=404
body=<!doctype html><html lang="en"><head><ti
```

The documented success test is `status == 200` (or a `2xx` range check) — it is
unaffected by error statuses landing in `status` rather than the error shape.

### Transport failure — `{status: 0, error}`

Only a genuine transport error — DNS failure, TLS handshake, connection refused,
a [deadline expiry](#timeouts), a mid-stream read error, an invalid method, or
an over-cap body — collapses to `status == 0` with a human-readable `error`
string and **no** `body`/`bytes`:

```mix
$r = http_get("http://127.0.0.1:1/")
print("status=" .. $r["status"])
print("error=" .. $r["error"])
```
```text
status=0
error=http://127.0.0.1:1/: Connection Failed: Connect error: Connection refused (os error 111)
```

`status: 0` is the one sentinel that means "no HTTP exchange happened" — a real
server never returns code 0, so a single `if $r["status"] == 0` cleanly
separates "the network broke" from "the server answered". The canonical guard:

```mix
$r = http_get($url)
if $r["status"] == 0 then
  print("transport error: " .. $r["error"])
else
  -- $r["status"] is a real HTTP code; $r["body"]/$r["bytes"] are present
end
```

## Text vs binary — `body` and `bytes`

`bytes` always carries the raw buffer. `body` is the **UTF-8 decode** of that
buffer, or `nil` when the bytes are not valid UTF-8 — so a binary response
(image, archive, anything high-bit) does **not** silently corrupt through a
lossy decode. An *empty* body decodes to the empty string `""`, not `nil` —
`nil` strictly means "not UTF-8". Reach for `.body` for JSON/text, `.bytes`
for binary:

```mix
$r = http_get("https://www.google.com/favicon.ico")
print("status=" .. $r["status"])
print("body_is_nil=" .. ("" .. ($r["body"] == nil)))
print("bytes_present=" .. ("" .. (not is_empty($r["bytes"]))))
```
```text
status=200
body_is_nil=true
bytes_present=true
```

For a text response, `body` is a normal string and `bytes` holds the same data
as a raw buffer — write it straight to disk with `write_file` (a bytes value
is written verbatim), or pass it to a [bytes helper](data.md):

```mix
$r = http_get("https://example.com")
write_file("/tmp/example.html", $r["bytes"])
```

To measure the buffer use `bytes_len($r["bytes"])` or, since **v0.64.0**, plain
`length($r["bytes"])` — both answer the byte count. The raw body can also be
indexed, sliced, iterated and searched directly (`bytes_find`, `bytes_split`,
`bytes_starts_with`); see [io](io.md#bytes-as-a-sequence-v0640).

## Headers

The optional `headers` argument is a **map**. Keys are header names, values are
stringified the usual way. If you don't set a `User-Agent`, `ureq`'s default
(`ureq/2.12.1`) goes out — the examples here set their own because some APIs
care:

```mix
$r = http_get("https://api.github.com/zen", { "User-Agent": "mix-docs" })
print("status=" .. $r["status"])
print("body=" .. $r["body"])
```
```text
status=200
body=Encourage flow.
```

A `bytes` **value** is rejected (not stringified) so the internal `<bytes:N>`
placeholder never ships over the wire — HTTP headers are text. If you genuinely
need binary header metadata, encode it yourself:

```mix
http_get($url, { "X-Token": $raw_bytes })
-- Runtime error: http: header `X-Token` does not accept bytes; base64_encode($v) first
```

One carve-out: a **sole** map in this slot whose keys are **all** opts keys
(`timeout`, `ssl_verify`, `ca_file`, `ca_pem`) is read as the opts map, not as headers — see
[the trailing-map rule](#the-trailing-map-rule). Any real-world header map
(carrying a non-opts key like `Authorization`) is unaffected.

## Request bodies

`http_post` (and `http_request`'s optional 3rd slot) send a body. A **string**
is sent as UTF-8; a **bytes** buffer is sent raw (so a binary upload doesn't go
through string coercion). Set `Content-Type` yourself — the client does not
guess it:

```mix
$payload = "{\"hello\":\"world\"}"
$r = http_post("https://httpbin.org/post", $payload, { "Content-Type": "application/json" })
print("status=" .. $r["status"])
$j = json_parse($r["body"])
print("echoed=" .. $j["data"])
```
```text
status=200
echoed={"hello":"world"}
```

`http_request`'s body slot is **`nil`-tolerant**: an absent or `nil` 3rd
argument sends a bodyless request (the right behaviour for `GET`/`DELETE`/
`OPTIONS`):

```mix
$r = http_request("GET", "https://example.com")   -- no 3rd arg → bodyless
print("status=" .. $r["status"])
```
```text
status=200
```

`HEAD` reports the real status with an empty body — a bodyless response is
not a transport failure:

```mix
$r = http_request("HEAD", "https://example.com")
print($r["status"] .. " / body=" .. length($r["body"]) .. " bytes")
```
```text
200 / body=0 bytes
```

> A `HEAD` response mirrors the headers a `GET` would return — including a
> `Content-Encoding` — but the server omits the body. The body is skipped
> rather than drained; before this fix, a `HEAD` from a server that sends
> `Content-Encoding` (example.com, github.com, …) collapsed to `{status: 0,
> error}` because the (empty) body was still run through a decoder.

An invalid method short-circuits to the error shape (no request is sent):

```mix
$r = http_request("BAD METHOD", "https://example.com")
print($r["status"] .. " / " .. $r["error"])
```
```text
0 / http: invalid request method "BAD METHOD" (must be an RFC 7230 token)
```

## Timeouts

Every call runs under a **total-request deadline — 30 seconds by default** —
one wall-clock budget covering connect, TLS, request write, and response read
(`ureq` itself sets no timeout; before mix 0.21 a stalled server could hang
the evaluator, and a login shell, forever). Override it per call with the
trailing opts map:

```mix
$r = http_get($url, {timeout: 5})            -- 5 s deadline
$r = http_get($url, $headers, {timeout: 5})  -- headers AND a deadline
$r = http_get($url, {timeout: 0})            -- no deadline (deliberately long transfer)
```

`timeout` takes a **non-negative integer, in seconds**. A fractional,
negative, or non-number value is a loud runtime error, and so is any other
key in the opts map — a typo can't silently produce an unbounded call:

```mix
http_get($url, {}, {timeot: 5})
-- Runtime error at line 1: http_get: unknown opt "timeot" (supported: timeout)
http_get($url, {timeout: 1.5})
-- Runtime error at line 1: http_get: timeout must be a non-negative integer, got 1.5
```

A deadline expiry is a **transport failure, not a raise** — the usual
`{status: 0, error}` shape. (There is no `timed_out` key; that is a
[`run_rc`](system.md) convention.)

```mix
$r = http_get("http://127.0.0.1:8098/", {timeout: 1})   -- a hanging server
print($r["status"] .. " / " .. $r["error"])
```
```text
0 / http://127.0.0.1:8098/: Network Error: Network Error: Error encountered in the status line: timed out reading response
```

### The trailing-map rule

The opts map rides in the **last** slot, after the optional headers (and, for
`http_request`, body) slots. To keep the common case short, a **sole trailing
map whose keys are all opts keys (`timeout`, `ssl_verify`, `ca_file`, `ca_pem`) is always read as the
opts map** — never as a headers map, and never as a request body:

```mix
http_get($url, {timeout: 1})                     -- deadline, not a `timeout` header
http_get($url, {ssl_verify: false})              -- skip TLS verification
http_post($url, $body, {timeout: 1})             -- deadline, not a header
http_request("GET", $url, {timeout: 1})          -- deadline, not a body
http_request("POST", $url, $body, {timeout: 1})  -- deadline, not a header
```

To genuinely send a literal `timeout` HTTP header, spell out the opts slot —
an empty opts map keeps the 30 s default:

```mix
$r = http_get($url, {timeout: "60s"}, {})   -- sends the header `timeout: 60s`
```

A map carrying any non-opts key (e.g. `Authorization`) is a plain headers map
(or, in `http_request`'s 3rd slot, a stringified body), so real-world maps never
trip the rule.

## Skipping TLS verification

TLS is on for every `https://` URL, and a bad certificate surfaces as a
transport error (`{status: 0, error}`), not a panic. Some internal endpoints —
Proxmox VE (`:8006`), Proxmox Backup Server (`:8007`), and other appliances —
serve a **self-signed** certificate that no public CA vouches for. Rather than
pin their CA, pass `ssl_verify: false` in the opts map to skip certificate and
hostname verification for that call, exactly like `curl -k`:

```mix
$r = http_get("https://b1.example:8006/api2/json/version",
              {"Authorization": $tok}, {ssl_verify: false})
```

The TLS handshake still happens — the connection is encrypted and the peer's
signatures are checked against the ring provider's algorithms — but the
certificate-chain / hostname **trust** decision is bypassed. That removes
protection against a man-in-the-middle, so use it **only** for endpoints you
reach over a trusted path (a private/WireGuard network, localhost, an SSH
tunnel). `ssl_verify` defaults to `true`; there is no way to disable
verification globally — it is always per-call and explicit.

## The 64 MiB body cap

A response body is buffered fully into memory and **capped at 64 MiB**
(`67_108_864` bytes). The cap exists so a huge or endlessly-streaming response
can't OOM a process embedding the Mix evaluator. An over-cap body collapses to
the transport-error shape:

```text
{status: 0, error: "http: response body exceeds the 67108864 byte cap (64 MiB)"}
```

This is a hard limit, not a tunable — these builtins are for API calls and
modest fetches, not for streaming multi-gigabyte downloads. For a large file,
shell out to a streaming tool by full path (see [run](system.md)), which takes
its own `{timeout: seconds}` opts map if you want the download bounded too:

```mix
run("/usr/bin/curl -fsSL https://example.com/big.iso -o /tmp/big.iso", {timeout: 600})
```

## Parsing responses

`body` is just a string, so feed it to the [data](data.md) builtins. JSON is
the common case — `json_parse` turns the body into a map/list with dotted /
indexed field access:

```mix
$r = http_get("https://api.github.com/repos/markc/mixos",
  { "User-Agent": "mix-docs", "Accept": "application/vnd.github+json" })
if $r["status"] == 200 then
  $j = json_parse($r["body"])
  print("name=" .. $j["name"])
  print("default_branch=" .. $j["default_branch"])
end
```
```text
name=mix
default_branch=main
```

For richer extraction use `jq(...)`; for a numeric field, `to_number(...)`. See
[data](data.md) for the full parse / serialize surface (`json_parse`, `jq`,
`data_encode`, the `bytes_*` helpers).

## Worked example — a guarded JSON fetch helper

The idiom in one function — single `status == 0` transport guard, then branch
on the HTTP code, parse on success. It uses the
[pass-in / return / reassign](functions.md) discipline (no shared globals):

```mix
fn fetch_json($url)
  $r = http_get($url, { "User-Agent": "mix-docs", "Accept": "application/json" })
  if $r["status"] == 0 then
    return { ok: false, why: $r["error"] }
  end
  if $r["status"] != 200 then
    return { ok: false, why: "http " .. $r["status"] }
  end
  return { ok: true, data: json_parse($r["body"]) }
end

$res = fetch_json("https://api.github.com/zen")
if $res["ok"] then
  print("got: " .. ("" .. $res["data"]))
else
  print("failed: " .. $res["why"])
end
```

## Notes & sharp edges

- **Blocking & synchronous.** Each call blocks until the response is buffered, the deadline expires (30 s default — see [Timeouts](#timeouts)), or the body cap / a transport error trips. There is no async variant — for latency- sensitive paths, tighten `{timeout: N}` and branch on `status == 0`.
- **No automatic retries, no cookie jar, no redirect-body replay** — `ureq`'s defaults apply (redirects are followed). Add your own retry loop if you need one.
- **TLS is on for `https://`.** A bad certificate surfaces as a transport error (`status: 0`), not a panic.
- **Headers and methods are validated** to block request-line / header injection: a non-token method and a `bytes` header value are both rejected in-band (the former as `{status: 0, error}`, the latter as a runtime error).
- **Don't confuse Mix-string `$(...)` with the URL.** In a double-quoted Mix string, `${name}` interpolates but `$(...)` is literal text — build URLs with `..` concat or `${...}`, e.g. `"https://example.com/api/" .. $id`. See [strings](strings.md).

## Serving — `http_serve`, `http_recv` (v0.75.0)

The other direction, deliberately minimal. **The boundary first**: no TLS
ever, and no dynamic handlers — certificates, vhosts, and request
dispatch to code are [webd]'s job and serve-mode citizens' job. What
lives here is the pair of shapes an agent keeps needing locally:

```
http_serve(root[, {port, host, duration, index, listing, render_md,
                   requests, spa, clean_urls}])
    -> requests served (BLOCKING)
http_recv(port[, {timeout, host, max, respond}])
    -> {method, path, query, headers, body, bytes, from_host, from_port} | nil
```

**`http_serve` is the `python -m http.server` slot**: serve a directory
to a browser — docs preview, a build artifact, a report. GET and HEAD
only; anything else answers 405. `port: 0` (the default) binds an
ephemeral port and **prints the URL** before serving, so the caller
always learns where. `host` defaults to `127.0.0.1`; exposing to the LAN
is one explicit `host: "0.0.0.0"`. `duration` bounds the run in seconds
(0 = until interrupted) — an in-flight request gets at most a 10-second
read grace past it, so one slow client cannot hold the server open;
`requests` stops after N exchanges; `listing`
opts into directory indexes; `render_md` (markdown feature) serves `.md`
files as styled HTML — `http_serve("docs/mix", {render_md: true})` renders
the raw manual `.md` files (but not the site's HTML shell, whose assets
live at the site root — serve the whole `docs/` tree, not a subdirectory,
if you want the interactive site).

The boolean options (`listing`, `render_md`, `clean_urls`) take a real
`bool` only — `"false"`, `1` or `nil` raise `TYPE_MISMATCH` before the
listener binds, never a truthiness read.

Traversal is the defended edge: the request path is percent-decoded
*first*, then the resolved file is canonicalised and must remain under
the canonicalised root — `../`, `%2e%2e%2f`, and symlinks inside the
root pointing out all answer 403/404, and the tests prove each one
against raw sockets (a polite HTTP client normalizes `../` away; an
attacker's socket does not).

**Serving a site with clean URLs, two shapes.** A static server maps
`/bus/props-core` to a file of that exact name and 404s when there isn't
one — but real sites use extensionless URLs. Two options cover the two
site shapes, and they compose (clean_urls is tried first — a specific
page beats a generic fallback):

- **`clean_urls: true`** — a would-be 404 on an extensionless path serves
  `<path>.html` when it exists (`/bus/props-core` → `/bus/props-core.html`).
  This mirrors GitHub Pages' pretty-URL behaviour, and is the fix for a
  **pre-rendered page-per-route site** — a real page or a router stub at
  every clean URL. A section page (`bus.html`) sitting beside its
  children directory (`bus/`) resolves too: `/bus` serves the page,
  `/bus/props-core` its child, and `/bus/` (trailing slash) stays a
  directory request. `http_serve("docs", {clean_urls: true})` serves the
  mixos.dev docs tree locally, fully styled, as Pages does.
- **`spa: true`** (or `spa: "shell.html"`) — a would-be 404 on an
  extensionless path serves ONE shell, so a **single-shell SPA**'s
  client-side router boots on every deep URL (`/users/42/settings` →
  the shell → the router renders). Point it at any Vite/React build.
  The shell path is checked at startup, not per request.

Both are frontend-only, and the boundary is exact: a **static SPA** —
assets from root, data from static files or a *separate* API — works
completely; `http_serve` serves the app, never runs its backend. A path
**with** an extension (`/main.css`, `/logo.png`) is never rewritten by
either option, so a genuinely missing asset stays an honest 404 instead
of silently becoming the HTML shell.

**`http_recv` catches ONE request and answers it** — the OAuth
localhost-redirect wait, the webhook test, the "curl me when the job is
done" rendezvous. It blocks up to `timeout` seconds (default 30, 0 =
forever), returns `nil` on timeout (an ordinary answer — poll again),
and hands back the full request: `body` as UTF-8 or nil, `bytes` always
the truth, headers lowercase-keyed. `respond` shapes the reply
(`{status, body, content_type, headers}`, default `200 ok`); `max` caps
the request body (default 1 MiB, refused with 413 beyond it).

```mix
-- wait for an OAuth redirect, answer the browser, extract the code
$r = http_recv(8910, {timeout: 120, respond: {body: "You can close this tab.\n"}})
if $r == nil then die "no redirect within 2 minutes" end
$code = parse_query($r["query"])["code"]
```

`http_serve` blocks until `duration`/`requests` ends it, or until
**Ctrl-C** — SIGINT stops the accept loop cleanly and the call returns
the count served so far, so an interactive `http_serve(dir)` is a normal
"serve until I stop it" command.

Both are sequential, `Connection: close`, one exchange per connection —
a browser and a script, not a load. The moment the words "certificate",
"virtual host", or "route this to a function" appear, the answer is webd.
