# cli — the `mix` meta-command

Inside the Mix REPL (and from the OS shell as `mix <subcommand>`) the bareword
**`mix`** is its own dispatcher: a built-in suite for introspecting the live
session, reading the language reference, building/testing the interpreter,
probing the Bus mesh, and driving AI-assisted workflows. It is *not* a Mix
builtin function — it is a command the shell intercepts before evaluation, so
you write `mix vars`, never `mix("vars")`.

Two execution contexts, one command surface:

- **From the OS shell** — `mix status`, `mix builtins math`, `mix what round`. The binary keeps an explicit allowlist of meta names and checks it *before* treating the argument as a script filename — so a script named `build` in the CWD is shadowed (run it as `mix ./build`). The session it reports on is the one that binary just started (so `mix vars` from a cold shell shows only the prelude functions), which makes the build/reference/mesh families useful while the *introspection* family is most meaningful inside a running REPL. `mix stats` also works here as a one-shot: every report names its window, and `mix stats coverage DIR` uses the real parser for static authorship coverage. See [usage statistics](stats.md).
- **Inside the REPL** — the same plus the **stateful** subcommands that need live REPL state: `time`, `trace`, `history`, `reload`, `diagnose` (and `stats` against the live in-session counters). Those live in the REPL loop, not `meta::dispatch`, because they need readline history, the trace flag, or the usage-stats handle. From the OS shell these names are *not* on the allowlist — `mix trace on` there is read as a script filename (`Error reading 'trace': No such file or directory`). After checking all meta names, the REPL also treats an existing first token as a script path: `mix FILE [args…]` runs it in a clean child process and returns to the same prompt. This is deliberately different from `source FILE`, which executes in and can modify the current session scope.

Bare `mix` prints the status overview **inside the REPL**; from the OS shell
it starts the REPL instead (use `mix status` there). Meta names win over CWD
files in both contexts, so `mix status` remains the status command even when a
file named `status` exists; use `mix ./status` to run that file. An unknown
non-file token inside the REPL prints
`mix: unknown meta-command '<token>' (and no such file)` on stderr and then the
subcommand overview (the `mix meta-commands:` listing); from the OS shell an
unknown name is tried as a script filename.

```mix
mix status
```

```text
mix 0.21.2
  pid:       50960
  uptime:    ?
  memory:    5776 kB
  variables: 0
  aliases:   0
  functions: 5
  scope:     1 frame(s)
  trace:     off
```

## Introspection — what is in the session

These read the live [scope](variables.md): variables, [aliases](shell-mode.md),
user [functions](functions.md), and the runtime config.

```
mix status      version + pid, uptime, RSS, var/alias/func counts, scope depth, trace
mix vars        every variable as `$name = value` (values over 60 chars truncated)
mix aliases     every alias as `name = expansion`
mix functions   every user function as `name(param, param)`
mix all         vars + aliases + functions under --- section headers ---
mix type NAME   classify NAME: builtin / keyword / alias / function / variable / PATH command
mix config      version, $HOME, prelude path, ~/.mixrc path, OS id, arch, pid
```

`mix type` resolves in the same order the evaluator does — builtin → keyword →
alias → user function → variable → `$PATH` command → not found:

```mix
mix type round
mix type ls
mix type bogusname
```

```text
round is a builtin function
ls is a builtin function
bogusname: not found
```

`mix functions` and `mix all` from a cold shell show the [prelude](builtins.md)
shims that ship in every session:

```mix
mix functions
```

```text
avg(list)
chars(s)
lines(s)
read_lines(path)
sum(list)
```

`mix config` is the quickest way to confirm which interpreter and rc file are in
play:

```mix
mix config
```

```text
version:  mix 0.21.2
home:     /home/user
prelude:  /home/user/.mixos/crates/mixos-lib-mix/std/prelude.mix
rc file:  /home/user/.mixrc
os:       linux
arch:     x86_64
pid:      50955
```

> `mix status` shows `uptime: ?` when run from the OS shell — the process has no
> recorded start instant for a one-shot invocation; inside a long-lived REPL it
> reports real uptime.

## Reference — learn the language

The reference family is self-documenting and verified against the binary, so it
never drifts from training data. Start broad with `mix help`, narrow with
`mix builtins CATEGORY`, pinpoint with `mix what NAME`, then read the full
prose with `mix man TOPIC`.

```
mix help              full categorized builtin reference + keyword list + subcommand map
mix keywords          every reserved word, one per line
mix builtins [CAT]    list builtins (derived signature + description); with a category, only that one
mix builtins --json   machine-readable contract table (metadata_schema 1 — see builtins.md)
mix builtins --data   same table as strict-data Mix source
mix builtins --names  bare name-per-line list
mix what NAME         one-line description of a builtin OR a keyword
mix man [TOPIC]       read a markdown manual page (no arg = the index)
mix syntax            shortcut for `mix man variables`
mix operators         shortcut for `mix man operators`
mix diff bash         bash → Mix translation cheatsheet
mix tutorial          guided walkthrough of the basics
mix examples          copy-paste-runnable snippets by category
```

`mix builtins` takes one of ten categories — `string type math list map io
system format json hof` — and prints each derived signature with its registered
description (signatures are generated from the structured contracts, 0.29.0):

```mix
mix builtins math
```

```text
math builtins:
  round(x[, n]) -> number          Round to nearest integer, half away from zero; round(x, n) to n decimal places (n<0 rounds to tens/hundreds) (v0.19.0)
  floor(x[, n]) -> number          Round down toward -inf; floor(x, n) to n decimal places (v0.19.0)
  ceil(x[, n]) -> number           Round up toward +inf; ceil(x, n) to n decimal places (v0.19.0)
  ...
  pi() -> number                   The constant π (v0.19.0)
  e() -> number                    Euler's number e (v0.19.0)
```

A bad category lists the valid set instead of failing silently:

```text
mix builtins: unknown category 'maths'
Categories: string, type, math, list, map, io, system, format, json, hof
```

All CLI/meta output is BrokenPipe-tolerant. If a downstream reader closes early,
Mix treats writes to that closed stream as normal and exits normally; it never
prints a Rust `Broken pipe` panic or exits `101`. For example, this is safe even though
`head` consumes only the start of the JSON report:

```text
mix builtins --json | head
```

The pipeline status remains the last command's status under ordinary shell
rules, so a successful `head` makes the pipeline successful.

`mix what` answers "what does this single name do?" for both builtins and
keywords from the same lookup:

```mix
mix what round
mix what send
mix what map
```

```text
round: Round to nearest integer, half away from zero; round(x, n) to n decimal places (n<0 rounds to tens/hundreds) (v0.19.0)
send: Send message to Bus port: send PORT "msg"
map: Return new list of transform(item) results (v0.2.0)
```

`mix apropos TERM` is the search when you *don't* know the name yet — one
case-folding substring pass across builtin names AND descriptions, keyword
names AND descriptions, and the manual's section headings, each hit saying
where to read more. It is the answer to "I need to pad a string but I don't
know it's called `lpad`":

```mix
mix apropos pad
```

```text
BUILTINS
  lpad  (string)  — Left-pad string to width (codepoint count; …) (v0.54.0)
  rpad  (string)  — Right-pad string to width (codepoint count; …) (v0.54.0)
  …
MANUAL SECTIONS
  mix man strings  § Padding with something other than a space
```

`mix what NAME` also falls through to this search when `NAME` is not an exact
builtin or keyword, so a near-miss surfaces the candidates instead of printing
`unknown` (v0.80.0).

`mix keywords` is the canonical reserved-word list — the names you cannot use
as function or variable *names* (`function step(...)` is an error). Since 0.21
a keyword IS accepted anywhere it is unambiguously a name — bare map keys
(`{label: 1, to: "x"}`), field access (`$m.to`), `send` kwargs — with the one
exception of `fn`, which lexes identically to `function` and still needs
quoting as a key. See [keywords](keywords.md).

```mix
mix keywords
```

```text
Mix reserved words:

  if
  else
  end
  for
  in
  while
  loop
  function
  fn
  return
  select
  ...
```

### `mix man` resolves online-first, with a local fallback

`mix man TOPIC` prints the markdown page `TOPIC.md`. The **canonical source is the
online documentation service** at [`mixos.dev/mix`](https://mixos.dev/mix) — the
same pages this site renders — because no tool can assume *where* (or whether) a
local checkout lives. Resolution order in the default `auto` mode:

1. **Fresh disk cache** — a copy fetched within the last 24 h short-circuits
   everything (no network, no latency on the common path).
2. **Online fetch** from `mixos.dev/mix` (2 s wall-clock budget, HTTPS-only, no
   downgrade redirects); a good page is cached under your XDG cache dir.
3. **Local checkout**, tried in this order — an *explicit* signal beats the
   default: `$MIXOS_SRC/mix` (when `MIXOS_SRC` is set) → `$MIXOS/docs/mix`
   (editing the repo's own pages) → `$MIXOS/mix` (a default checkout).
4. **Stale cache**, if the network is down and no checkout is present.
5. Otherwise a *not-found* message naming the paths searched and how to force
   local mode.

No argument reads the index (`README.md`); an unknown topic lists the available
ones (the list excludes `README` itself):

```mix
mix man math        -- prints the math page (online, cached, or local)
mix man             -- prints the index
mix man nope        -- "no manual page for 'nope'" + available topics
```

**Environment controls:**

- `MIXOS_MAN_SOURCE=local` — skip the network entirely; resolve only from a
  local checkout (then stale cache). Use it when editing pages and wanting your
  edits to win immediately, or when deliberately offline. Default is `auto`.
- `MIXOS_MAN_URL=<base>` — override the online base URL (default
  `https://mixos.dev/mix`). Points the fetch + cache at an alternate host.
- `MIXOS_SRC=<dir>` — adds `<dir>/mix` as the highest-priority local checkout.

`mix syntax` and `mix operators` are thin aliases — `mix man variables` and
`mix man operators` respectively. To add a topic, drop `TOPIC.md` into
`docs/mix/`; it publishes to `mixos.dev/mix` on the next Pages build and is
reachable as `mix man TOPIC` with no code change.

### `mix diff bash`

A side-by-side translation table for anyone arriving from bash — it captures the
sharp edges directly (`$` sigils everywhere, `..` for concat, `end`/`done`/`next`
for block close, `$rc` instead of `$?`). `mix diff sh` is accepted as an alias;
any other language names the available set (`available: bash`):

```mix
mix diff bash
```

```text
Bash to Mix Translation Cheatsheet

Bash                               Mix
──────────────────────────────     ──────────────────────────────
VAR="value"                        $var = "value"
echo "$VAR"                        print $var
if [ -f file ]; then               if is_file("file") then
[[ -z $a ]]                        if $a == "" then
for i in 1 2 3; do                 for each $i in [1, 2, 3]
...
```

## Build — rebuild the interpreter from itself

The build family wraps `cargo` against the Mix source tree (`$MIXOS_SRC`,
default `$MIXOS`) so the REPL can rebuild and re-exec into a fresh binary —
the self-reconstruction surface. Point `$MIXOS_SRC` at the directory holding
the workspace `Cargo.toml` (in a clone of the public repo that is `mix/src`).

```
mix build       cargo build --release, then install target/release/mix → $MIXOS_BIN/mix
mix clean       cargo clean (removes the target/ tree)
mix update      git pull, then build + install
mix test        cargo test, streaming output
mix self check  syntax-check ~/.mixrc and std/prelude.mix without executing them
mix check FILE  syntax-check one .mix file (lex + parse, no execution)
```

`mix build` removes the destination first (a running ELF can't be written in
place — `ETXTBSY`), copies the new binary in, and — when run from the REPL —
saves history then `exec()`s into it, so the new interpreter replaces the old
process live. As a one-shot from the OS shell it installs and simply exits
(there is no REPL to restart). `mix update` is `git pull` then the same build.

`mix check` is a fast parse-only gate — perfect for a pre-commit hook or
validating a script before shipping it:

```mix
mix check /tmp/ok.mix      -- a well-formed file
mix check /tmp/bad.mix     -- an unterminated function header
```

```text
OK: /tmp/ok.mix
/tmp/bad.mix: Parse error at line 2:1: expected variable, got Eof
```

`mix self check` validates your two startup files. `~/.mixrc` is treated as a
hybrid Mix-plus-shell file (it tolerates bareword shell lines), while
`std/prelude.mix` must be strict, whole-file-valid Mix:

```mix
mix self check
```

```text
~/.mixrc: OK
std/prelude.mix: OK
```

(A `.mixrc` that mixes bareword shell lines with Mix reports
`OK (mixed shell+Mix)` — the per-line classifier validated every line.)

### `mix watch` — the edit-test loop

`mix watch PATTERN COMMAND` is a polling file-watcher: every 250 ms it scans
the current directory for files matching PATTERN and runs COMMAND (via
`sh -c`) when one changes, with a 500 ms debounce. Globs are simple — `*.ext`,
or `**/*.ext` to recurse (hidden directories and `target/` are always
skipped). Ctrl-C stops it.

```mix
mix watch '*.mix' 'cargo test'
```

## Diagnostics — measure and trace

### `mix doctor` — is this install healthy, and what am I talking to?

One command answering both questions, from the OS shell or the REPL. Each line
is `✓` (fine), `⚠` (a caveat, with the fix), or `✗` (broken, with the fix):

```
mix doctor
```

```text
mix doctor — mix 0.81.0

  ✓ version    0.81.0 · git 1a2b3c4d5e6f · built 2026-09-05T…Z
  ✓ features   json regex markdown toml serde datetime url crypto http sqlite dkim datastar xml yaml ws
  ✓ prelude    loaded (2 functions in scope)
  ✓ manual     33 page(s) readable
  ✓ stats      writable at /home/you/.local/state/mix
  ✓ bus        reachable at ws://…/ws

healthy — no ✗ checks
```

It **exits non-zero if any `✗` check fails**, so it gates: `mix doctor && deploy`.
The `features` line is the honest set THIS binary was compiled with (a slimmed
build reports fewer, never claims a capability it lacks); the `bus` line is a
bounded reachability probe — the whole connect runs on a worker thread capped at
~600 ms, so even a hostname endpoint with a dead resolver cannot hang it. Set
`MIX_DOCTOR_SKIP_BUS` to skip the probe entirely (the line then reads `—`), for
a hermetic run that touches no broker. The checks are deliberately local —
version/provenance, compiled features, prelude, manual (checkout **or** `mix man`
cache), stats-dir writability, and Bus — with no fleet awareness; that belongs
to the hub's tools. Only the `stats` check can fail hard (`✗`); an unreachable
Bus is a `⚠`, never a `✗`, so `mix doctor` still passes on a standalone box.

These need live REPL state (readline history, the trace flag, the stats
handle), so they are handled in the REPL loop rather than `meta::dispatch`.
Apart from `mix stats` — which also runs one-shot from the OS shell against
the on-disk data — they are **not** available as `mix …` from the OS shell.

```
mix trace [on|off]    per-statement tracing to stderr (no arg = report state) — see below
mix history [PAT]     show readline history, optionally filtered to lines containing PAT
mix reload            re-execute ~/.mixrc in the current session
mix diagnose [on|off] auto-send REPL errors to Claude for diagnosis (needs the claude CLI)
mix stats [SUB]       usage tracking — see below
```

### `time` — the timing modifier

`time` is a shell-dispatch **modifier**, not a meta-command: it wraps whatever
follows — an external command, a pipeline, a bareword function, or Mix code —
and reports elapsed time on stderr. Unlike the rest of this section it is NOT
REPL-only; it works under `-c` and over ssh too. Full semantics:
[shell-mode](shell-mode.md).

```mix
time sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```

```text
15
Elapsed: 0.012ms
```

`mix time EXPR` is the same modifier under its older spelling. Before 0.32.0 it
was a REPL-only meta-command that could time Mix code but not a command, and a
bare `time cmd` died with `time: No such file or directory` — bash's `time` is a
keyword, so there is no `time` binary for the classifier to find.

### `mix trace` — the statement tracer

`mix trace on` prints one line **to stderr** for every statement executed, in
the form `trace <file>:<line> <kind>` — in the REPL the file shows as
`<repl>`:

```mix
mix trace on
$x = 41
print($x + 1)
```

```text
Trace: on
trace <repl>:1 Assignment
trace <repl>:1 Print
42
```

Shell-dispatch lines are traced too, as `trace <repl> shell: <cmd>` —
external binaries, pipelines, `cd`, and whole `&&`/`||`/`;` chains (a chain
traces as one line, after alias expansion). The `mix …` meta-commands
themselves are excluded as REPL machinery, as is the prompt's own render.

The tracer is self-contained: no `RUST_LOG` needed, and `RUST_LOG` does
**not** enable it (a `tracing` subscriber exists only under `--serve`) — the
stderr line is the real channel. It is REPL-only: it cannot be armed under
`--serve` or from a non-interactive `ssh host '<mix>'`. Current state shows in
`mix status` (`trace: on|off`) and `mix context` (`"trace": true|false`);
`mix trace` with no argument reports it.

### `mix stats` — usage tracking

`mix stats` aggregates which builtins, functions, aliases, commands, keywords,
meta-commands, and error kinds you actually use — including a `never` report
of builtins/keywords you have never invoked. Data lives under
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/mix/` (default `~/.local/state/mix/`) as weekly JSON files,
mirrored into a `mix.db` SQLite database when the `sqlite3` CLI is on `$PATH`
(that database backs `trend`/`since`/`query`). `MIX_STATS=0` disables the
subsystem. Run `mix stats` for the top-20 overview, or a subcommand:

```
mix stats              top 20 most-used across all categories
mix stats builtins     per-builtin usage counts          mix stats never      never-used builtins/keywords
mix stats functions    user-function counts              mix stats sessions   session history
mix stats aliases      alias expansion counts            mix stats raw        current stats as JSON
mix stats commands     external-command counts           mix stats reset      reset current counters
mix stats keywords     keyword counts                    mix stats clear NAME remove NAME from every category
mix stats meta         meta-command counts               mix stats all        aggregate every weekly file
mix stats errors       error-kind counts                 mix stats week W     one week (e.g. 2026-W27)
mix stats trend NAME / since DATE / query SQL            SQLite history
```

## Files — `mix edit`, the one-line edit that refuses to guess

```
mix edit [--all] [-n|--dry-run] FILE OLD NEW
```

Replace **OLD** with **NEW** in **FILE**. OLD is matched *exactly* —
byte-for-byte, no pattern syntax, no delimiter to choose, nothing to escape.

This exists to remove the `sed -i` reflex, which was never about the language:
a one-line edit *from a prompt* had no Mix shape shorter than writing a `.mix`
file. So the contract is the opposite of `sed`'s on the two axes that actually
bite:

| | `sed -i 's/OLD/NEW/'` | `mix edit` |
|---|---|---|
| OLD is not present | exit **0**, file unchanged, says nothing | exit **1**, file unchanged, says so |
| OLD occurs twice | edits the first match **on every line** (all of them with `g`), silently | exit **2**, **writes nothing**, names every matching line |
| OLD contains `.` `*` `/` `[` | matches other text, or is a syntax error | a literal dot, star, slash, bracket |
| what changed | nothing printed | the changed line, as `-`/`+` |

```
$ mix edit src/main.rs "0.89.2" "0.89.3"
src/main.rs:3
- version = "0.89.2"
+ version = "0.89.3"
```

An ambiguous needle is a refusal, not a choice:

```
$ mix edit conf.mix "port = 8080" "port = 9090"
mix edit: conf.mix: OLD occurs 2 times; file unchanged
  conf.mix:4: port = 8080
  conf.mix:19: port = 8080
Pass --all to edit every occurrence, or give a longer OLD.
```

**Exit codes** — the reason this is a subcommand and not a meta-command
(meta-commands all exit 0):

| rc | meaning | file |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | edited | written |
| 1 | OLD not found | untouched |
| 2 | OLD occurs more than once and `--all` was not given | untouched |
| 3 | usage error, unreadable file, unwritable **directory**, non-UTF-8 input, or a file that changed since it was read | untouched |

(rc 3 is about the *directory*, not the file's own write bit: the edit is a
temp-file rename, so a read-only file in a writable directory is edited and
keeps its read-only mode.)

`--all` is the explicit opt-in to edit every occurrence. `-n` / `--dry-run`
reports the matches and writes nothing.

**Flags come first, then `FILE OLD NEW` verbatim.** Option parsing stops at the
first non-flag argument, so OLD and NEW can be any text at all —
`mix edit f.rs "=>" "->"` and `mix edit f.rs 1 -1` are ordinary edits, not
unknown options. `--` forces the switch early, for a FILE that starts with a
dash. A flag *after* FILE is a usage error that says so.

Other properties worth knowing:

- **OLD may span lines.** Pass a `"one\ntwo"` and the two-line block is one
  needle. The printed diff shows every line the edit touches, on both sides.
- **Overlapping candidates are not an ambiguity.** `aa` in `aaa` is one
  occurrence, because that is what the edit will actually replace — counting
  overlaps would refuse an edit that was never ambiguous.
- **The write is atomic.** A sibling temp file is created `O_EXCL` at 0600,
  written, fsynced, given the original's permission bits and renamed over it.
  An interrupted run leaves the old file intact, an edited script keeps its
  executable bit, and a pre-placed file or symlink at the temp path is refused
  rather than followed.
- **A symlinked FILE is followed.** The edit lands on the target and the link
  survives as a link — renaming over the link itself would silently replace it
  with a regular file and leave the real target stale.
- **A file that changed since it was read is refused** (rc 3, nothing written),
  so a concurrent edit or an editor save is a refusal rather than a silent
  overwrite. This narrows the race to the gap between the re-check and the
  rename; it is not a lock, and a writer landing inside that gap still wins.
- **`OLD == NEW` is a usage error** (rc 3), not a no-op, because it is
  invariably a mistake.

`mix edit` works at the interactive Mix prompt as well as from the OS shell;
there the exit code lands in `$status`.

In a script the nearest equivalent is [`replace()`](strings.md) — but it is
**silent** when the needle is absent, returning the input unchanged, so a
script doing this has to check the result itself.

## Ecosystem — probe the Bus mesh

These query the local [noded](bus.md) broker for its registered Bus service
roster (the mesh is TCP noded — `ws://<wg-ip>:4200/ws` — resolved the same way
the [`send`](bus.md) keyword resolves a target). All three fail fast with a 5 s
timeout so a stale broker address can't hang a diagnostic.

```
mix mesh          mesh status + the full list of services the local noded knows
mix ports         the registered Bus ports/services with a count
mix ping SERVICE  is SERVICE reachable? (`noded` itself is always the local broker)
```

```mix
mix mesh
```

```text
Bus mesh active via local noded (ws://192.0.2.10:4200/ws)
  dnsd
  indexd
  log
  webd
4 service(s) registered
```

```mix
mix ping webd
mix ping noded
mix ping nope
```

```text
webd: reachable (registered with noded)
noded: reachable (local broker)
nope: not found
```

When no broker is running the same commands degrade to a clean one-line message
(`No mesh — local noded not reachable (...)`) rather than an error.

There is also a small **orchestration** group: `mix deploy SVC`
(`systemctl --user restart mixos-SVC`), `mix health [SVC]` (probe Bus unix
sockets in `/run/bus`, falling back to `/tmp/bus`), and `mix logs SVC [-f]`
(`journalctl --user -u mixos-SVC`, last 50 lines; `-f`/`--follow` to stream).
These assume a systemd-user-managed MixOS install.

## AI-powered — agent-driven workflows

The AI family shells out to the Claude Code CLI (`claude -p "<prompt>"`); each
constructs a task prompt pointed at the Mix source tree. If `claude` is not on
`$PATH` they print an install hint and stop — they never alter anything on their
own.

```
mix fix DESC      read source, write a fix + test, run cargo test
mix extend DESC   implement a feature (tests first), run cargo test

A related triad — `mix ask QUESTION` (one-shot Claude query with session context
injected), `mix chat` (interactive Claude with a Mix-aware system prompt), and
`mix context` / `mix snapshot` (export vars + functions + aliases + runtime info
as JSON) — feeds the live session into an agent. `mix context` is the
machine-readable companion to `mix all`:

```mix
mix context
```

```text
{
  "aliases": { ... },
  "current_line": 42,
  "cwd": "/home/user",
  "extensions": [ ... ],

```

Finally, `mix claude-start` / `mix claude-stop` / `mix claude-status` manage
the `mixos-claude` Bus port daemon (socket
`/run/user/<uid>/mixos/ports/claude.sock`): `start` spawns the binary
(searched in `$MIXOS_SRC/target/{release,debug}/`, then `$PATH`), `stop`
removes the socket, `status` probes it and flags a stale socket.

## Notes

### Native pane-shell status (stage A)

An S3-enrolled interactive shell answers `shell.status` on its existing,
broker-allocated pane-shell name and connection. It creates no extra service,
transport, builtin or legacy `--serve` handler. The resident remains responsive
while readline, Mix evaluation or a managed foreground child occupies the shell.
Non-attached shells allocate no status state, timers or worker threads.

The bounded JSON request (at most 2048 bytes) has `version: 1`, `target` and
no replay cursor. `target` contains `broker_epoch`,
`record` (`record_id`, `incarnation`, `binding_generation`), `instance_id`,
`pane_id` and `pane_generation`, exactly as supplied by current S3 discovery.
Unknown request fields, invalid versions and malformed values are refused.

Replies contain a versioned `status.snapshot`, capabilities and freshness
metadata. Snapshot phases follow these boundaries:

| Phase | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `starting` | Before ShellReady, including startup hooks |
| `idle` | After ShellReady, evaluation finish, or a line that ran nothing |
| `prompt-preparing` | Building the primary prompt, including custom `prompt()` |
| `prompt-ready` | Editor activated; `continuation` distinguishes secondary prompts |
| `evaluating` | An accepted line is being classified, expanded or evaluated, with a command ID |
| `foreground-child` | A foreground producer holds a bracket |
| `exiting` | Shell exit or replacement |

 Prompt generation increases for every new
primary or continuation prompt; `continuation` distinguishes them. Custom prompt
evaluation is `prompt-preparing` without a command ID; continuation prompts do
not enter that phase. An accepted line allocates its monotonic command ID at
acceptance, not at evaluation, so the window in which it is classified and
alias-expanded reports `evaluating` with that ID rather than `idle`. The ID is
retained through foreground waits, and cleared when the evaluation finishes or
when the line turns out to run nothing — an empty line, an incomplete
continuation or a parse error — which returns the phase to `idle`.
The foreground phase follows the job kernel's terminal lease for foreground
pipelines and `fg`, and brackets the existing synchronous `run_stream` spawn/wait.
This observation does not change `run_stream` job or signal semantics and does
not enumerate jobs.

The reducer supplies the owned editor's next prompt generation. Only its actual
Editing acknowledgement commits that value and prompt-ready; a deferred,
suspended or failed begin publishes nothing. Deferred foreground activation
commits exactly once, and later suspend/resume of the same prompt does not bump
it. `prompt_binding_generation` and `prompt_source` retain the identity supplied
at Begin, while `source` names the current attachment. Zero/null means the prompt
began before attachment. The full source plus prompt generation is required for
future admission; the editor's numeric binding component alone is not identity.
Legacy readline reports its entry boundary because it has no activation
acknowledgement. `cwd` is the last observed directory, captured at shell startup
and successful shell `cd` (including `cd -`, pushd/popd and sourced shell lines)
or Mix `chdir()` transitions. Failed changes preserve it. Paths are bounded to
4096 UTF-8 bytes with explicit truncation; unavailable observations are null.

The version-1 reply's `status` has exactly `snapshot`, `sampled_ms`,
`transition_age_ms` and `cwd_age_ms`. These times use the shared CLOCK_BOOTTIME
clock, in milliseconds since status-state creation, including time suspended;
they are not wall time. Admission lease-age comparisons use that same clock.
`sampled_ms`, `transition_age_ms` and `cwd_age_ms` state freshness at sampling;
delivery delay adds to those ages. A snapshot is information, never an execution
permit. No background polling of cwd, editor or evaluator occurs. Producers
commit owned transitions under a short state lock; transport, serialisation,
filesystem calls, evaluator calls and child waits occur outside that lock.
The 64-transition replay ring is internal in stage A. Replay cursors, gap
reporting and event delivery are deferred to stage B and absent from this v1
request/reply contract. Binding changes advance the same sequence. Historical
transitions retain their original source, while replies name the current source.

Admission uses BROKER-023 `read_state`: owning Term and explicitly scoped current
principals, plus independent same-UID verified owners under `default-open`.
Restricted policy denies ambient callers; cross-UID, TCP, unverified and sibling
principals receive the same bounded `REFUSED` response without status or target
details. Id-less notices never enter status admission or receive replies. Bound callers cannot fall back to ambient rights.
Correlated lease checks revalidate both caller and target at admission, and
detached residents do not dispatch requests. Admitting a session-bound caller
costs one lease check plus one re-read of the resident's own attachment: the
connection's broker epoch and connection id are fixed for its lifetime and are
taken once, not per check. Every session RPC serialises on that one connection,
so a renewal that loses its deadline to admission load is retried once with a
fresh deadline before the attachment is given up. Stale targets return
`STALE_GENERATION`. Recovery uses S3; it never resets shell sequence or prompt
generation. Jobs, signals, foreground/resume,
isolated tasks, input and event publication report `UNSUPPORTED`, never `BUSY`.
Evaluation submit and inspect report what this build can actually do — see
stage D below — and report `UNSUPPORTED` wherever it cannot.
The resident runs at most four admission tasks alongside its receive/renew/restart
loop, one of which is reserved for the pane's own Term: other same-UID callers
share three, so a flood by them cannot starve the owner into uniform refusals.
That reservation is a scheduling class only — the reserved slot re-runs the whole
admission policy like any other. Excess requests receive `REFUSED`; refusal writes
are polled alongside control rather than blocking it, including when the transport
has already dropped, so an admitted request is never answered with silence.
Restart cancels outstanding admission tasks.
The verified lane retains at most 64 commands of at most 64 KiB envelope/body.
Its reader task neither writes nor waits: an overflowed request is handed to the
receive owner, which writes that connection's `REFUSED`, and a dropped id-less
lifecycle notice raises a delivery gap the resident treats exactly as it treats
the broker's own lifecycle gap. Other clients retain their existing receive
configuration.

### Native pane-shell execution (stage D)

The same enrolled attachment answers `shell.execute`, `shell.execute.result`
and `shell.execute.cancel`. These are BROKER-023 `execute`, not `read_state`:
holding the capability that answers questions about the shell does not reach
them, and a caller without `execute` is refused before learning that the family
exists.

**Admission is empty-primary-prompt only.** A submission is admitted when the
shell is at `prompt-ready`, not a continuation, with an empty draft, no history
search, no paste in progress and no partially-decoded key — and when the
`prompt_generation` it names is the one actually at the prompt. Anything else
is refused, and the refusal discards nothing: a half-typed line is still there,
character for character, and finishing it runs the human's line.

| Situation | Answer |
|---|---|
| Empty primary prompt, generation matches | admitted |
| Half-typed draft, history search, paste in progress | `BUSY` |
| Continuation prompt | `BUSY` |
| Evaluating, foreground child, starting, exiting | `BUSY` |
| Custom `prompt()` still rendering | `BUSY` |
| Wrong prompt generation, or a target that is not this shell | `STALE_GENERATION` |
| No owned editor (the rustyline path) | `UNSUPPORTED` |
| Retention table full | `RESOURCE_LIMIT` |
| Same request id, different body | `CONFLICT` |
| Unauthorised, or the attachment lost mid-admission | `REFUSED` |

Nothing queues behind a busy shell. There is no state in which a submission is
accepted now and executed at some later prompt, because a caller cannot know
what the shell will be doing then — and a snapshot is information, never an
execution permit.

The admitted line is **visibly echoed before it runs**, through the editor's own
terminal, naming the principal and the command id:

```
mix: execute #7 admitted for Term ff86c6c7: print("hello")
```

The source in that line is escaped by a printable **allowlist**, not a blocklist:
anything outside ordinary printable text is rendered rather than emitted. That
covers the characters `is_control` does not report — bidi overrides and
isolates, zero-width joiners, the BOM, a soft hyphen, `U+2028`/`U+2029` — each
of which can reorder or hide what a reader sees without being a control code. A
submission is attacker-chosen bytes drawn into a terminal a human is reading,
and the allowlist means a new trick is escaped by default rather than passed
through by omission.

A source too long for one line is truncated with its tail NAMED:

```
mix: execute #7 admitted for PaneShell 9c1f via Term ff86c6c7: <head> …[+812 bytes, sha256:3ab19f04]
```

Nothing executes with an unannounced tail, and two submissions sharing a head
are still distinguishable. When a forwarder relays somebody else's submission
the announcement reads `<originator> via <forwarder>`: the shell authenticated
the forwarder, not the name it relayed, and the wording says so rather than
implying the shell verified it.

If the whole line cannot be put on the glass, the pane says
`announcement abandoned; nothing executed` instead — an announcement is
zero-or-whole, because a partial one reads exactly like a real admission.

**A reservation takes nothing away.** Between the moment the shell agrees to run
a submission and the moment it commits, the prompt is still live: still in raw
mode, still being read a byte at a time, still the human's. Any input at all
during that window — a single character, even one that edits nothing — ends the
reservation, and the submission is refused having announced nothing. The
terminal only changes hands at the commit itself, which is one atomic step:
reads stopped, cooked mode restored, announcement written, line executed. That
ordering is why a keystroke can never be painted into the announcement by kernel
echo, and can never arrive as the admitted execution's standard input.

Execution then follows the same path a typed line takes — the same classifier,
aliases, job integration and history policy — adopting the command id that was
minted, echoed and recorded before it started. Admission never opens a
continuation: a submission that turns out to be an incomplete line is refused
and the prompt is returned, because a remote execution may not leave a human
holding half of someone else's line.

`shell.execute` answers immediately with `{"state":"running","operation_id":…}`;
`shell.execute.result` returns that operation's state and, once it has one, its
result. Both it and `shell.execute.cancel` are scoped to the actor that
submitted — holding `execute` authorises driving the shell, not reading back
what somebody else drove it to do — and an operation belonging to another actor
is refused exactly like one that does not exist.

Retries are BROKER-018 idempotent: an identical submission under the same
request id replays the recorded answer rather than executing a second time.
**Request ids must be monotonic per caller.** A spent id stays spent even after
its record is gone (see the cap below), so reusing a lower id answers
`UNKNOWN_OUTCOME` rather than executing; callers going through Term get this
for free, because Term mints its own sequence, but a direct caller has to keep
its own counter.
**Fifteen minutes is the ceiling, not a promise.** The store holds 256
operations, and a busy shell reaches that long before it reaches the clock; the
oldest COMPLETED record is then evicted (a running one never is). What survives
eviction is a per-actor high-water mark, so a retry whose record is gone answers
`UNKNOWN_OUTCOME` rather than executing a second time — the id stays spent even
when its result no longer exists.

Three refusals are worth telling apart, because they are different facts:

* `BUSY` — nothing was announced and nothing ran. The request id is untouched
  and the same submission may simply be retried. This is the commonest refusal
  by design: a reservation is given up the instant the human touches the
  keyboard, so a busy pane produces it routinely.
* `UNKNOWN_OUTCOME` with `reason: admission_abandoned_before_execution` — proven
  that nothing ran, but the id is spent and its outcome recorded. Retrying it
  replays that; use a new id to try again.
* `UNKNOWN_OUTCOME` with `reason: admission_claimed_without_report` — the shell
  cannot say whether the line ran. The named `operation_id` stays resolvable, so
  `shell.execute.result` on it is how the caller finds out.

The result is serialised on the evaluator owner, so no interpreter value ever
crosses to the Bus thread:

```json
{"state":"finished","result":{
  "outcome":"completed",  "status":0,
  "value":{"type":"string","version":1,"bytes":"11","truncated":false,"text":"hello world"},
  "duration_ms":"3",
  "cancellation":{"requested":false,"delivered":"none"}}}
```

`outcome` is the execution's verdict and `value.truncated` is a property of how
much of the answer fitted. They are independent: a command that succeeded and
returned more than 16 KiB still succeeded.

### Isolated supervised tasks (P4)

`shell.task.submit` / `shell.task.result` / `shell.task.cancel` are the SECOND
execution mode, and almost everything above does not apply to them. An
evaluation runs inside the shell; a task is a separate process. It therefore
has no prompt to be admitted at — **BUSY is never a task refusal**, and a task
submitted while the human is mid-line runs anyway. That independence is the
point of the mode.

A submission carries exactly one of `source` (Mix text) or `argv` (program and
arguments, never a shell string); both or neither is `INVALID_ARGUMENT`. `cwd`
is required and must exist. `timeout_ms` is required, non-zero and capped at ten
minutes. There is no stdin in v1: the task gets `/dev/null`, and a
stdin-feeding task is a named future field rather than a silent absence.

**The environment is enumerated, not inherited.** A task starts from exactly:

    HOME  USER  PATH  LANG  TERM=dumb
    MIXOS  MIXOS_SRC  MIXOS_BIN  MIXOS_ETC
    MIXOS_NODE_CONFIG  MIXOS_BROKER_ACCOUNT

plus the caller's `env` overlay, which WINS on a name collision. Those values
are snapshotted when the shell STARTS, so a task sees the shell's startup PATH
and not whatever the shell has since set. Nothing else crosses: a variable the
shell sets at runtime does not reach a task, and the fixtures assert that as
whole-set equality rather than by spot-checking names.

**Termination is hard here, and it is the only hard guarantee in the surface.**
Cancel or timeout sends SIGTERM to the task's process GROUP, waits two seconds,
then sends SIGKILL. The reported outcome is read from `wait()`, never from the
fact that a signal was sent — a cancel request is still not proof a process
stopped, but the wait status is. The outcome names the POLICY that ended the
task (`timeout`, `cancelled`) with the signal beside it as `escalated_to`, so a
deliberate deadline is never presented as an indistinguishable external kill.

If the bounded termination ladder cannot obtain a final wait status, the
report says `unknown`; it never claims a successful exit from sending SIGKILL.
Since Mix 0.109.0, that report is published before waiting for eventual kernel
cleanup. The original supervisor keeps the child registered and retains its
native concurrency slot until reaping completes. Four pending supervisors
still exhaust the four-slot limit and further submissions receive
`RESOURCE_LIMIT`, even if their reports have already settled. Reaping retries
interrupted waits, and registry removal is synchronised with shutdown sweeping.

Between a cancel being accepted and `wait()` settling, `shell.task.result`
reports `state: "cancelling"` — a real state, so a caller that asked for
cancellation and reads `running` is not left wondering whether its request
arrived.

Streams are captured separately and exactly; this is the mode the manual points
to when interactive attribution is only best-effort. Each is capped at 64 KiB of
ENCODED text — what the reply actually costs, not what was read, because a NUL
costs one byte to capture and six to encode — with the REAL byte count and a
`truncated` flag reported, and truncation never turns a successful task into a
failed one.

A task's descendants can outlive it holding the inherited pipes open. Once the
supervisor has its outcome the drains get the same two-second grace and then
stop, and the stream reports `writer_survived: true`: the report says it stopped
listening rather than presenting a bounded read as the whole of the output.
Nothing waits on a process nobody is supervising, so a task that backgrounds a
ten-minute sleeper still settles at once and gives back its concurrency slot.

In `source` mode the value travels a dedicated descriptor rather than stdout —
see `--result-fd` below — so a task that prints and a task that returns are not
competing for one stream. `argv` mode has no interpreter value and says
`not_applicable` rather than presenting an absent one as a failure.

**Declared limits.** A task's lifetime is bounded by the shell's, through two
mechanisms because neither covers the other's case. `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` binds the
task LEADER to the supervisor thread that forked it, which is what survives a
SIGKILL of the shell — no teardown hook runs then. But pdeathsig reaches the
leader alone, so a normal exit would leave the leader's own children running;
the shell therefore SIGKILLs every live task GROUP on its way out.

The declared residual is narrower than "any grandchild": a process that leaves
the task's group by calling `setsid` or `setpgid` for itself is outside both
mechanisms and survives. That is the orphan case, stated rather than dressed up
as a containment the implementation does not have.

`umask` and rlimits are inherited and are the operator's bound; the shell's own
bounds are the concurrency cap (four), the timeout, and 4 KiB each for `argv`
and the `env` overlay — sized to what the 8 KiB dispatch request can actually
carry, so each is a limit a caller can really provoke rather than decoration.
The two answer differently on purpose: an over-budget `env` overlay is
`RESOURCE_LIMIT`, because the overlay is a quantity of state the shell declines
to carry, while an over-budget `argv` is `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, because the command
line itself is malformed for this surface.

A spawn that fails is never `INVALID_ARGUMENT` — the request was well-formed,
and the failure happened after validation accepted it. Which code it does get is
decided by errno, because the two halves call for different responses. A program
that is not there, or a `cwd` that stopped being a directory between validation
and the fork, is `NOT_FOUND`: the caller named it and can correct it, and it is
deliberately the same code validation gives for a missing `cwd`, so one mistake
does not change its name depending on how fast the filesystem moved. Everything
else — out of descriptors, out of memory, out of processes — is `RESOURCE_LIMIT`
with `reason: "spawn_failed"`, which is the transient class: back off and retry.
Either way the request id stays unspent, and the error set stays closed, so a
caller can still switch on it exhaustively.

**Advertised deferrals**, refused explicitly rather than left to look like
typos: `shell.task.watch` and `shell.task.list` answer `UNSUPPORTED` with
`reason: "deferred"` — a bare code would be word-for-word what an unknown verb
gets back, which is not an advertisement of anything (v1 is poll-only, through
`shell.task.result`); there is no stdin feeding; there is no
reply chunking (the 64 KiB caps stand in for it); and a task has no Bus identity
of its own — it is supervised state inspectable through the owning shell, not a
mesh citizen.

#### `mix --result-fd N`

`mix --result-fd N -c <source>` writes the final expression value, encoded by
the interpreter's own strict-data serializer, to descriptor `N` as a
big-endian u32 length followed by exactly that many bytes. `N` must be above
stderr and must already be open; both are checked at startup and refused
loudly, because a task promised a structured result that silently produced none
is the failure with no symptom.

The flag must precede `-c`, which consumes the rest of the line as script
arguments, and it is refused outright without one: `-c` is the only mode that
produces a value to frame, so accepting the flag anywhere else would promise a
result that never arrives. Text streams are untouched: `-c` has never echoed its
final value to stdout, so stdout stays the program's own output and the value
travels the descriptor.

The whole frame is capped at 64 KiB, not just the value inside it. The value is
encoded once and then escaped again as it goes into the frame, so capping only
the inner encoding let a quote-heavy value produce a frame too large to read —
which the reader then saw as a writer killed mid-write. An oversized value comes
back as a truncated reference instead: the caller learns a value existed, and
how big it was.

An evaluation stopped by a signal writes an ERROR frame naming the signal and
exits non-zero. It has to: the interpreter catches SIGTERM for its own graceful
shutdown, and a supervisor ends a task with exactly that signal — so without
this, a cancelled task and one that genuinely returned nil produced identical
successful frames. (A plain `mix -c` with no result descriptor still exits 0 on
Ctrl-C; scripts depend on it, and that is not the case this rule is about.)

The length prefix is what makes four situations distinguishable that an unframed
stream collapses into one: nothing written at all (`result_missing`), a declared
length the payload does not satisfy because the writer was killed mid-frame
(`result_torn`), a partial frame the supervisor stopped waiting for because a
survivor still held the pipe (`result_abandoned`), and a complete frame whose
value reports that it was larger than the cap.

#### Cancellation, and what it is actually worth

`shell.execute.cancel` resolves one immutable evaluation identity. A request for
an evaluation that has already finished says so and signals nothing, so a
cancellation can never reach a successor evaluation — the failure mode the
single process-wide interrupt flag made inevitable. `SIGINT` is mapped the same
way: the signal records which evaluation was running when it arrived, so a
Ctrl-C at an idle prompt cannot trip the next line. A cancelled evaluation's
intent is sticky, so a Mix `try`/`catch` around cancelled work cannot swallow it
and run on.

Delivery is cooperative, and the table says only what is true:

| Path | Guarantee |
|---|---|
| Ordinary statements | cooperative, at the evaluator's existing checkpoints |
| Optimised native loops | cooperative, at the existing periodic check |
| Captured runners (`run_argv`, `run_pipeline`) | existing polling; the runner abandons its child |
| Managed interactive foreground job | **SIGINT to the process group**, via the job controller — the one path that does not depend on the target polling anything |
| `run_stream` | not interruptible while blocked in the child wait |
| `serve()` | **not covered**: its interrupt is a process-wide shutdown request, consumed by the pump's own exit rather than reported as a delivered cancellation |
| Blocking HTTP, filesystem and device calls; uncooperative extensions | **no pre-emption** |

The group signal is SIGINT and stops there. Escalating to `SIGTERM` and then
`SIGKILL` would need a grace period this shell does not run a clock for, and a
shell that escalated on its own would destroy work a human could still have
recovered with `fg`. The `cancel` reply reports `signalled_pgid` when a real
group signal went out, so a caller can tell the two strengths apart rather than
having to assume.

What cannot be promised is not promised: arbitrary builtin pre-emption,
rolling back side effects, killing threads, or terminating descendants after
they detach. Bounded termination of uncooperative work needs a separately
supervised process, which by construction cannot inherit or mutate this shell's
scope. `cancel` reports `requested`, `already_finished` or `unknown`, and a
finished evaluation's report distinguishes `cancelled` from `completed_anyway`.

Noninteractive shells, `--serve`, `mix -c` and any shell without an attachment
carry none of this: no surface is registered, no admission state is allocated,
no result store exists, and `serve`'s process-wide shutdown semantics are
untouched. One thing is NOT unchanged, and it applies to every Mix process: the
SIGINT handler now also records which evaluation a signal was aimed at, so
`interrupt::init` registers one additional chained handler. Two relaxed atomic
stores, no allocation, no behaviour change to what the signal does — but it is a
difference, and "byte-identical" would have been a claim this page could not
back.

- `mix` is intercepted by the shell, so it never sees `$`-sigil arguments — write `mix what round`, not `mix what $name`.
- The introspection family (`vars`/`aliases`/`functions`/`all`/`context`) is most useful **inside a REPL**, where the session has accumulated state; from a one-shot OS-shell invocation it reports only the freshly-loaded prelude.
- The diagnostics family (`time`/`trace`/`history`/`reload`/`diagnose`) is REPL-only — those names are not on the OS-shell allowlist, so `mix trace on` there is read as a script filename. The one exception is `mix stats`, which has a dedicated one-shot OS-shell path against the same on-disk data.
- Paths follow the MixOS layout: source at `$MIXOS_SRC` (default `$MIXOS`), installed binaries at `$MIXOS_BIN` (default `~/.local/bin`, or `/usr/local/bin` when running as root).
