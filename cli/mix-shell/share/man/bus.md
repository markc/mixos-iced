# bus — MixOS Agent Bus messaging (send / emit / address / on)

**Bus messaging is what makes Mix more than "a better shell."** `send`, `emit`,
`address`, and `on … end` are *language keywords*, not library calls — Mix talks
to a local message broker (and, over the mesh, to remote brokers) with no SDK,
no client object, no boilerplate. This is the ARexx lineage made native: every
service is a named, addressable port; a Mix one-liner can drive any of them.

> **Most examples on this page need a live broker** (`noded`, from the
> [cos repo](https://github.com/markc/mixos)). Where a broker is running the output
> shown is real, captured from `mix 0.21.2`. Where no broker is present the Bus
> forms **degrade gracefully** (see [No broker](#no-broker-graceful-degradation)) —
> that path is verified separately. Treat the networked examples as illustrative
> of the shape; the language facts (keywords, `$result`/`$rc`, RPC vs
> fire-and-forget, target syntax) are exact.

```mix
send noded noded.ping            -- RPC to the LOCAL broker
print("rc=" .. $rc)
print("" .. $result)
```
```text
rc=0
result={extensions: {core: 1.0, topic: 1.0}, pong: true}
```

## Connection events

In `--serve`, `on bus.connected` receives `{generation}` in `$event.args` after
the initial connection and after reconnection. The generation comes from the
supervised client's successful-connection counter; it is not a wall-clock time
or the script's reload generation. Use the event to refresh snapshots and
reconcile after a broker restart, without a recovery timer.

The adapter waits on `subscribe_state()`. It emits at most once per observed
connected generation. State changes can coalesce while a handler is busy:
generations can skip, so treat the notice as a request to resynchronise rather
than an audit log of every connection. The state observer is shared with the
supervised connection across script reloads; a reload alone does not emit a new
connection event. A dropped receive future preserves state readiness. The lazy
non-serve Bus connection contract is unchanged.

Local native events (`fs.changed`, `proc.exited`, `bus.connected`) share the same
handler dispatch and `$event.args` conversion as incoming Bus events. Structured
event bodies are parsed even in a library build without the optional JSON
*builtin* feature. This introduces no new transport or local-only command gate;
the citizen's public verbs retain their existing local/mesh routing.

## The model in one paragraph

A **broker** (`noded`) runs on the node. Services register a **name**
(`noded`, `statecache`, `webd`, …). You **`send`** a service a **command** (a
dotted verb like `noded.ping`) with optional **key=value args**; the reply lands
in `$result` and the status code in `$rc`. That's an RPC. **`emit`** is the same
shape but fire-and-forget — no reply, no wait. **`address`** is a block of
implicit sends to one target. **`on … end`** is the other direction: it
*subscribes* a handler that fires when a matching message arrives — the basis of
a Mix [citizen](#serve-mode-mix-as-a-daemon) that *is* an addressable service.

The win over bash/python: there is no equivalent without a client library. In
Mix it is grammar.

## `send` — RPC (request/reply)

`send <target> <command> [key=value …]` dispatches a command and **waits for the
reply**. Three result variables are set as a side effect:

| Var | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `$result` | the reply value (a [map](collections.md), list, string, … — field-accessible) |
| `$reply` | the WHOLE reply body, JSON-parsed, for every response — success or refusal, whatever its dialect — and `nil` when the body is empty or not JSON, or the send never got a reply (0.92.0). See [below](#reading-rc-ok-vs-application-error-vs-transport-failure). |
| `$rc` | numeric status in signed bands: `0` delivered+accepted · `1..9` delivered with a warning (still success) · `>= 10` peer application error (the exact peer rc is kept) · `-1` transport failure · `-2` per-send `timeout=` exceeded · `-3` Bus unavailable (no broker). All negatives are non-fatal. |

```mix
send noded noded.info
print("rc=" .. $rc)
print("" .. $result)
```
```text
rc=0
{node: node1, noded: {binary: noded, name: noded, pid: 1342, version: 0.6.10, ...}, schema_version: 1, service_count: 8, uptime_s: 9445, wg_ip: 192.0.2.5}
```

`$result` is structured data — reach into it with `.field` access or `["key"]`
(see [collections](collections.md)):

```mix
send noded noded.ping
if $result.pong then
  print("pong is true")
end
print("core ext: " .. ("" .. $result.extensions.core))
```
```text
pong is true
core ext: 1.0
```

### Verb names with keyword segments (mix 0.96.2)

A bare verb is a dotted name, and **any segment may be a Mix keyword** —
Bus verbs belong to the services that define them, and `select`, `if`,
`print`, `end` are ordinary verb words there:

```mix
send ced ced.select anchor=0
send edit edit.select
emit x x.if.for
on ced.select
  reply("ok")
end
```

The same rule holds everywhere a bare Bus name is written: the `send`/`emit`
command, `address` body lines, a dotted target (`send print.x verb`), and the
`on` handler header. A keyword may also *lead* the name, but only when dotted
(`send svc select.all`, `on print.page`); a bare keyword verb (`send svc
select`) stays a parse error — quote it: `send svc "select"`. `fn` and
`function` segments are read by their source spelling (`x.fn` is `"x.fn"`).
Before 0.96.2 a keyword segment failed with `unexpected token Dot` and the
verb had to be quoted (`send ced "ced.select"`); quoting still works.

### `send` as an expression

`send` also returns the reply, so you can capture it directly (it still sets
`$result`/`$rc` too):

```mix
$r = send noded noded.ping
print("captured: " .. ("" .. $r))
```
```text
captured: {extensions: {core: 1.0, topic: 1.0}, pong: true}
```

### Args: scalars, `body=`, and numbers

For `send`, bare `key=value` args are serialized as a **JSON body** (RPC
framing) by default — noded/indexd/maild verbs read their args from it — with
two exceptions that select **header routing** (scalar args → Bus headers,
`body=` → the body channel):

- a `body=` key is present (the caller is speaking the headers+body shape), or
- the command is a SPEC-12 namespace-mode property call — `<svc>.props.<op>` (incl. multi-segment ops like `props.audit.watch`) with a `namespace=` arg — which reads args from Bus headers, so a kv-only `send webd webd.props.get namespace=x key=y` works without an explicit `body=""`. (SPEC-07 flat-path reads — `noded.props.get path=…` — carry no `namespace=` and stay JSON-body, as their servers expect. Both triggers apply on the broker path only; the local Unix-port path has no header mode.)

(`emit` header-routes **all** map args — RPC-style JSON body is a `send`/`call`
shape.) Whole-number args serialize as JSON **integers**,
not floats — so `limit=2` arrives as `2`, and a peer field typed `usize`/`i64`
accepts it; a fractional value (`2.5`) stays a float.

A `body=`-bearing `send` **awaits its reply** exactly like a positional or
scalar-header send — the handler's `reply(...)` lands in `$rc`/`$result`. (Only
`emit` is fire-and-forget; the arg shape never changes whether a reply is
collected.)

```mix
send noded noded.ping limit=2 note="hello"
print("rc=" .. $rc)
```
```text
rc=0
```

### Reading `$rc`: ok vs application error vs transport failure

A `$rc` of `>= 10` from a *reachable* broker is an **application** error (e.g.
unknown service, rejected command) — the peer's exact rc is preserved (a peer
`rc=42` stays `42`, never flattened to `10`) and it does **not** mean the mesh is
down. A `$rc` in `1..9` is a delivered-with-warning success:

```mix
send nonesuch some.cmd
print("rc=" .. $rc)
print("result=" .. ("" .. $result))
```
```text
rc=10
result=Service 'nonesuch' not found
```

A **negative** `$rc` is a *local*, non-fatal signal — the send never reached a
peer, so `$result` carries the reason string and the script continues: `-1`
transport failure (a broker was there but the send failed — lost or broken
connection), `-2` a per-send `timeout=` budget exceeded, `-3` Bus unavailable (no
broker was ever present, a bare host). See [timeout](#per-send-timeout) and
[no broker](#no-broker-graceful-degradation).

**A structured refusal keeps its body — on the header route.** When a
header-routed send (one with a `body=` arg, or a SPEC-12 `*.props.*` call with
`namespace=`) gets `rc >= 10` with a JSON object naming an `error_code`,
`$result` is that object — field-accessible, so `$result.error_code` and
whatever else it carries (`reason`, `retry_requires`) are readable. (0.87.0)
The ordinary JSON-body send never did this: there `$result` is the `error`
header, else the body's `error` string, else the body text verbatim — so an
`error_code` body with no `error` field arrives as raw JSON TEXT in `$result`.
On either route, read the structure from `$reply` (below), which is the parsed
body whatever its shape; `$result` is for the message.

**`$reply` keeps every field of every reply.** Most daemons refuse in the other
dialect — `{"error": "occluded", "under": {…}}` — and `$result` reduces that to
its message string on purpose, so existing scripts keep working. The detail
(`occluded.under`, `stale_target.current`, `timeout.waited_ms`,
`invalid_args.allowed`) is in `$reply`, the whole parsed body:

```mix
send comp comp.window.focus id=2
if $rc == 10 and $result == "occluded" then
  print("covered by window " .. to_string($reply.under.id))
end
```

`$reply` is set on every `send` (and every address-block line): the parsed body
for a success (the same value as `$result`) or a refusal of either dialect, and
`nil` when the body is empty or not JSON, or when no reply arrived (`$rc < 0`).
One limit: a target reached over its **local Unix port** (a sibling
user-service, not the broker) reports a refusal as a message only, so there
`$reply` is `nil` for a refusal. (0.92.0)

**`$rc`, `$result` and `$reply` are shared, not per-call.** A `send` updates the
existing variable of that name — and once a top-level `send` has created them,
that is the script's global, so a `send` inside a function or an `on` handler
overwrites it too. In a `mix --serve` citizen whose async handlers interleave,
handler A can `send`, yield, and read back the `$rc`/`$result`/`$reply` of
handler B's send. (`$event` is only partly different: a handler BODY's own
`$event` is per-invocation, but a function called from that body reads a
shared global `$event` and has the same interleaving hazard — pass `$event`
into the function as an argument.) Per-invocation binding of all three is
planned (filed in the Mix TODO list). Until it lands, read them immediately
after the `send`, or capture the reply with the expression form —
`$r = send svc cmd` — and copy `$rc` into a local before the next await.

**A wrong verb name answers at once.** A `mix --serve` citizen (or any script
with `on` handlers) that receives a request for a command it has no handler
for refuses it immediately with `rc 10`. On an ordinary send `$result` is the
message ("unknown command 'x' (this citizen handles: …)"); on the header
route (a `body=` send) the `error_code` rule above makes `$result` the whole
object instead. Either way the structure is in `$reply` —
`$reply.error_code == "UNKNOWN_COMMAND"`, `$reply.command` the verb you sent,
`$reply.available` the citizen's declared handlers. (Before 0.92.0 the request
was dropped: the caller waited out its full timeout and got `-2`, which read as
a mesh problem.) So a `-2` from a citizen that answers its other verbs is no
longer a typo symptom — look at the citizen's handler instead. Props paths such
as `lifecycle.generation` are not verbs: read them with
`send svc svc.props.get path="lifecycle.generation"`. The code is a Mix
citizen's: other daemons name the same refusal differently — comp answers
`unknown_verb`, noded its own rc 10 message — so a script that must work
against any service should test `$rc >= 10` and read the code from `$reply`
rather than match one spelling.

**A Mix citizen's runtime refusals are all in the error band.** Besides
`UNKNOWN_COMMAND`, the serve runtime answers a request itself in two more
cases, each with an `error` message and an `error_code`. `rc` 15 and 16 are
the runtime's; pick another `rc >= 10` for a handler's own `reply()` refusals,
and treat `error_code` as the authoritative signal:

| `$rc` | `$reply.error_code` | When |
|---|---|---|
| 10 | `UNKNOWN_COMMAND` | no `on` handler for the verb |
| 15 | `HANDLER_FAULT` | the handler raised, `die`d or panicked before replying; the real error is in the citizen's log, never on the wire |
| 16 | `HANDLER_CANCELLED` | the citizen shut down or reloaded while the handler was still running |

Before mix 0.94.0 the last two answered `rc 1` and `rc 2`, which this section
defines as delivered-with-warning success, so a `$rc >= 10` check missed them.
See [handler fault isolation](serve.md#handler-fault-isolation-the-per-request-boundary).

## `send` and the verified session lane

A locally registered service can be addressed two ways, and only one of them
carries an identity. A TCP connection is known by a name the caller asserts
about itself, which is not an authority — which is why a session-enrolled
service's protected verbs answer `FORBIDDEN` over it. A Unix connection to the
local broker carries peer credentials the KERNEL supplies, so the broker learns
who is calling without having to be told.

`send` now prefers that verified lane, with no change to how you write it:

```mix
$list = send noded "noded.list"          -- find the instance
$r = send $name "term.session" body=$b   -- a protected verb, admitted
```

This grants no new authority. Any same-uid process can already open this
connection — the pane shell and every test harness do — and a local
`DefaultOpen` service admits the resulting session-less ambient principal for a
matching uid/node/broker epoch. What was missing was a way for a SCRIPT to use
it. (0.87.0)

**The fallback is not an error path.** Where no verified lane is available — a
headless host with no local broker socket, a broker running under another
account, a genuinely remote target — `send` falls back to exactly the path it
used before and behaves exactly as it did. The attempt costs nothing when the
socket is absent: a path that does not exist fails at the stat, not at a
timeout. The lane is chosen once per connection, so a script can never end up
with some sends authenticated and others not.

**Discovery.** `noded.list` projects by uid: a caller that owns a record gets
its full `ServiceInfo` including the session details, while everyone else gets
the bare name. A driver over the verified lane is same-uid by construction, so
one `send noded "noded.list"` is enough to find a service's per-instance name
and address it.

---

## `emit` — fire-and-forget

`emit <target> <command> [key=value …]` dispatches and returns immediately. No
reply is awaited and **`$rc`/`$result` are not set** by `emit` — it is a
statement that yields `nil`, used when you don't care about (or can't get) an
answer, e.g. publishing to a topic or notifying a service.

```mix
emit noded noded.ping note=hi
-- no $rc is written by emit; do not read it after an emit
print("emitted")
```
```text
emitted
```

Gotchas:

- `emit` is a **statement**, not an expression — `$x = emit …` is a parse error. (`send` *can* be an expression; `emit` cannot.)
- Because `emit` writes neither `$rc` nor `$result`, reading `$rc` right after an `emit` (with no prior `send`) raises *undefined variable `$rc`* — pre-init it or just don't.

---

## `publish(topic, body[, opts])` — one-call topic publish (0.63.0)

Publishing to a topic used to require two pieces of lore: the body handed
to `noded topic.publish` must itself be a **SPEC-02 wire frame**
(`---\ncommand: …\n---\npayload`), and the `send` needed `body=` spelled
before `name=`/`retain=` would header-route. `publish()` does both:

```mix
$rc2 = publish("comp.corner.entered", json_encode({corner: "tl"}))
if $rc2 != 0 then eprint("publish failed: " .. $result) end
```

- `topic` — the noded topic name; by default it is also the inner frame's
  `command:` header (what subscribers' `on` matches).
- `body` — the payload **string** (`json_encode` a map first — the wire
  format is the caller's choice, never hidden). `nil`/absent → empty.
- `opts` — `{retain: bool}` (default false); `{command: "corner.entered"}`
  overrides the inner frame header (the fleet publishes topic
  `comp.corner.entered` with inner command `corner.entered`);
  `{headers: {event_seq: 1042}}` adds frame header lines. Topic, command
  and headers are newline-checked — frame injection raises instead of
  corrupting the wire.

Sets `$rc`/`$result` exactly like `send` (and sets `$reply` to `nil`, so an
earlier send's reply is never read as the publish's) and returns the rc, so
`if publish(..) != 0` reads naturally. Without a broker it degrades like
`send`: `$rc = -3`, non-fatal.

**Hyphenated targets need no quoting.** `send comp-nested …`,
`emit desktop-vt1 …` and `address shell-scenes-p2 … end` all read the
hyphenated name whole. Hyphenated service names are the norm on the mesh, so
the bare form has to work; quoting and `$var` remain exactly equivalent
spellings.

The accepted shape is deliberately narrow, and is the
[shell classifier](shell-mode.md)'s tight-hyphen rule for command heads plus
`.` for dotted names: an ASCII letter or `_` first, at least one `-`,
alphanumerics / `_` / `-` / `.` within, an alphanumeric or `_` last, and the
whole thing delimited by whitespace, a newline, a `;`, or end of input.
A first segment that is a Mix keyword is fine too (`next-hop`, `print-server`,
`on-boot`), because a bare keyword in target position was never anything but a
parse error.

Anything else keeps the expression reading it always had — a call
(`send env("DEST") …`), an index, a parenthesised expression, a `$var`, and a
**spaced** `send a - b …`, where the space says an operator was meant. The one
exception is a concat whose left operand is a bare hyphenated word
(`send a-b .. "c" …`): that is now a *parse* error where it used to be a
runtime one, because the word is taken as the target and the `..` is left with
nowhere to go. It could never have been a working concat — the left operand of
`..` there is a bareword, which is a string, so the subtraction ahead of it
always failed first.

**Quote a name the bare form cannot reach.** Two shapes fall outside it, and
quoting is the answer to both:

| name | why | write |
|---|---|---|
| `a--b` | `--` opens a **comment**, so the bare word stops there and the shape is refused | `send "a--b" …` |
| `fn-svc` | `fn` starts a lambda | `send "fn-svc" …` |

All-digit segments are fine bare, including malformed-looking ones: `svc-1`,
`svc-10`, `bterm-bevy-3164175`, `desktop-vt01`, and since 0.92.0 also `svc-01`,
`node-007` and `a-1.2.3`. Before 0.92.0 the lexer read a leading-zero or
multi-dot segment as a bad NUMBER and refused the line
(`ambiguous leading-zero number '007'`, an error that never mentioned `send`);
it now lexes such a segment as part of the word when it sits in the bare target
right after `send`/`emit`/`address`. Everywhere else — `$x = 007`, a
`$var-007` target, a hyphenated command — the refusal is unchanged.

Nothing that worked before changed meaning: the shape *requires* a hyphen, so
every target that already resolved still takes the expression path, and a
bareword is a string, so `a - b` on two barewords was always the runtime type
error "cannot use 'a' as number" rather than arithmetic. (Before this, the
bare form died at runtime with exactly that message while `mix --check` and
`mix lint` both passed the line — an earlier version of this paragraph told
you to quote it and said the grammar would not change.)

---

## `address` — a block of implicit sends to one target

`address <target> … end` opens a block where **each line is an implicit send**
to that target. Drop the `send` keyword inside the block — writing it is a parse
error (the runtime catches the typo deliberately). Each line sets `$rc`/`$result`
in turn, so after the block they hold the **last** send's outcome.

```mix
address noded
  noded.ping
  noded.info
end
print("rc=" .. ("" .. $rc))
```
```text
rc=0
```

`address` is the ergonomic ARexx-style "talk to one port for a while" form. It is
purely a shorthand for repeated `send <same-target> …` lines.

---

## Targets: static dotted `.bus` vs dynamic built

The **command position** of `send`/`emit`/`address` accepts an expression, and so
does the **target**. Two shapes matter:

**1. A bare local service name** — `noded`, `statecache`, `webd`. The broker
routes it on the local node.

```mix
send statecache INFO
print("" .. $result)
```
```text
{description: Mix supervised Bus citizen (SPEC 18 Phase 1 runtime), name: statecache, version: 0.21.2}
```

**2. A static dotted `.bus` address** — `<service>.<node>.bus` addresses a
*remote* node's broker directly, mesh-routed, **no ssh and no string building**.
This literal-address path fires only for a **bare identifier immediately followed
by a dot** (e.g. `noded.node1.bus`); a single bareword, a `$var`, a `(paren expr)`,
a bareword call like `env("X")`, an index, and a `..` concat all stay ordinary
expressions.

```mix
-- illustrative (needs the named node to exist on the mesh):
send noded.node1.bus noded.info
print("" .. $result)
```

Self-addressing works — `send noded.<thisnode>.bus` resolves to the local broker.

**3. A dynamic target from a loop/var** — build the address (or the verb) with
`..` concat. This is the path when the node name isn't a literal:

```mix
$node = "node1"
$target = "noded." .. $node .. ".bus"
-- send $target noded.info   -- illustrative; routes to that node's broker

-- the verb is an expression too:
$verb = "noded" .. ".ping"
send noded $verb
print("rc=" .. ("" .. $rc) .. " result=" .. ("" .. $result))
```
```text
rc=0 result={extensions: {core: 1.0, topic: 1.0}, pong: true}
```

> Edge: if an inline `(expr)` in command position collides with the parser,
> pre-build the verb into a `$var` (as above) and pass the var.

---

## Per-send `timeout=`

`send … timeout=<seconds>` puts a wall-clock budget on the RPC (cooperative
cancellation; the pending-reply slot is freed on expiry). On timeout you get
`$rc = -2` (RC_TIMEOUT) — its **own** numeric band, distinct from `-1` transport
— with a `timeout: …` reason in `$result`. Non-fatal: the script continues.

```mix
-- against a 2s-slow downstream:
send slowsvc do.work timeout=0.5
-- $rc     == -2      (RC_TIMEOUT, numeric)
-- $result == "timeout: send to slowsvc exceeded 0.5s"
```

Rules (all raise a `RuntimeError` if violated): `timeout=` must be a **finite,
positive** number; **absence** means "no timeout" (there is no sentinel value);
`nil` is treated as absent (so `timeout=$t` is fine when `$t` may be unbound);
duplicate `timeout=` is last-wins. The `timeout=` slot is consumed locally and
does **not** appear in the args delivered to the peer.

---

## `port_exists(name)` — is a service registered?

A builtin (not a keyword) that asks the broker whether a named service is in its
registry. Useful as a guard before an RPC.

In `--serve`, a failed registry request raises a catchable mesh-unavailable
error (Mix 0.109.0). Only a successful registry response can establish that a
service is absent. `emit` retains its fire-and-forget, non-fatal language
contract during a transport failure; it supplies no delivery acknowledgement.

```mix
print("statecache: " .. ("" .. port_exists("statecache")))
print("ghost:      " .. ("" .. port_exists("ghostservice")))
```
```text
statecache: true
ghost:      false
```

> Note: the broker need not list *itself* in its service registry, so
> `port_exists("noded")` can return `false` even while `send noded noded.ping`
> succeeds — `port_exists` reflects the **registered-services list**, not broker
> reachability.

---

## `on … end` — receiving messages (handlers)

`on <command> [desc "doc-string"] [async] … end` (`desc` and `async` compose
in either order) registers a **handler** that fires when a matching Bus
message arrives. The handler body uses newline- or
`;`-separated statements closed by `end` — **no `do` keyword**. The
`<command>` matches the *inner command* of the inbound message (the verb the
publisher sent), **not** the topic/target name — check the publisher to know
what to match. The optional `desc "…"` doc-string (mix ≥ 0.87.1) is static
metadata: a serve citizen surfaces it as the verb's `description` in its
`HELP` reply — see [Serve citizens](serve.md).

```mix
on order.created desc "Acknowledge a new order"
  print("got an order: " .. $event.body)
  reply("ack")
end
```

The `<command>` is a dotted name whose segments may be Mix keywords
(`on ced.select`, `on print.page`) — see
[keyword segments](#verb-names-with-keyword-segments-mix-0962).

Legacy `done` still closes `on` (with a deprecation warning); prefer `end`.

### The `$event` map

Inside a handler, the inbound message is available as `$event`, a map with four
fields:

| Field | Type | Access |
|---|---|---|
| `$event.command` | string | the inbound verb |
| `$event.headers` | map | scalar headers, e.g. `$event.headers["topic"]` |
| `$event.body` | string | the raw message body |
| `$event.args` | parsed body \| nil | the body pre-parsed as JSON, or `nil` |

```mix
on topic.delivery
  $topic = $event.headers["topic"]
  print("delivery on " .. $topic .. ": " .. $event.body)
end
```

**`$event` has dynamic extent** (0.63.0): a `fn` the handler body calls —
at any depth — sees the same `$event`, so helpers like
`fn describe() return $event.headers["topic"] end` work. (Before 0.63.0
the handler→fn hop lost it — function frames only fall through to globals
— and the resulting `NAME_UNDEFINED` was swallowed by fault isolation:
the blind-but-healthy citizen.) A fn's own `$event` parameter or local
still shadows it; `$event` stays read-only inside the dispatch; after the
dispatch a top-level `$event` global is restored (or reads `nil` if there
was none).

`$event.args` is a convenience view of the body: when the sender used the
JSON-body path — a **positional** `send svc cmd "a" "b"` (which arrives as
`{"_0":"a","_1":"b"}`) or a **map** arg — the body is already-parsed JSON, so
`$event.args["_0"]` / `$event.args.field` save you a `json_parse($event.body)`.
It is symmetric with the already-parsed `$event.headers` map; `$event.body`
stays the raw string regardless.

`$event.args` is `nil` when the body is empty or is **not** JSON — a raw
`body="hi"` text payload reads back as `nil`, so a handler tells "structured
args" from "raw text" and reaches for `$event.body` in the latter case:

```mix
on order.submit
  if $event.args != nil then
    reply("ok, item " .. ("" .. $event.args["_0"]))   -- send order.submit "widget"
  else
    reply(10, "expected structured args, got: " .. $event.body)
  end
end
```

### `reply(...)` — answer a request

From inside an `on` handler servicing a **request** (one expecting a reply), call
`reply(body)` or `reply(rc, body)`:

```mix
on statecache.get
  reply($current_value)         -- rc defaults to 0
end

on do.validate
  if not $event.body then
    reply(10, "missing input")  -- non-zero rc = application error to the caller
  else
    reply(0, "ok")
  end
end
```

`reply` rules: `rc` must be an integer `0..=255`; it may only be called from
inside an `on` handler; it errors loudly if the current event is *not* a request
(a topic delivery has no caller to answer). A dropped reply would block the
requester forever, so every `reply` failure path is a hard error by design.

### `async` handlers (Class C)

`task_start(command, body)` starts a registered handler chain in process,
without sending a Bus message. `command` and `body` are strings; the body is
decoded into `$event.args` just as for other handler invocations. The event
has empty headers and no reply correlation. The chain must contain an `async`
handler (`TASK_HANDLER` otherwise). It uses the existing Class C task registry,
shutdown drain and runner LocalSet; embedders must provide that LocalSet.
The builtin requires Process capability and is refused in expression mode.

Mixed chains retain declaration order: an async entry can wait on `sleep`,
then a plain entry acquires the writer lock and reads current state to commit.
Never assign a whole pre-wait state copy after a yield. A clock can start one
local task at init and recheck its running flag on `bus.connected`, with no
Bus self-emits. A task is a local continuation, not a separate service or
transport, and does not provide exactly-once remote effects.

A trailing `async` on the handler header marks it **Class C** — the dispatch
*yields* at every `send`/`reply`/`sleep_ms` so concurrent invocations interleave
instead of head-of-line-blocking each other behind a slow downstream call. Plain
(non-`async`) handlers are **Class S**: run-to-completion, one at a time. Use
`async` only when a handler makes a slow/remote downstream `send` and the citizen
serves concurrent callers.

```mix
on aggregate.report async
  send slow.upstream fetch.data          -- yields here; peers can interleave
  reply($result)
end
```

`async` is a *contextual* modifier, not a reserved word — variables/keys named
`async` elsewhere are unaffected. **Synchronous request cycles (A→B→A) are
prohibited and deadlock** — `async` does not legalise them; break a cycle with
fire-and-forget `emit` + a topic reply instead.

### `subscribe` / `unsubscribe` — topic pub/sub

`subscribe("topic.name")` registers interest in a [topic](bus.md) so topic
deliveries reach a matching `on` handler; `unsubscribe("topic.name")` drops it.
Both are builtins that require a live broker — unlike `send`/`emit`, they
**raise** rather than no-op when no broker is reachable (a script must not believe
it subscribed when it didn't).

```mix
subscribe("metrics.cpu")
on metrics.cpu
  print("cpu sample: " .. $event.body)
end
-- … then enter serve mode / the event pump to actually receive them
```

## Serve mode — Mix as a daemon (citizen)

`mix --serve <script.mix> [--name <service>]` runs a script as a **first-class,
supervised Bus citizen**: the top-level body executes once as init (open
resources, `subscribe`, register `on` handlers), then the runtime registers the
service name and enters the event pump, dispatching inbound messages to your `on`
handlers. This is the AmigaOS "application with an ARexx port" model — a
long-lived, addressable Mix process that *is* a service. The full lifecycle
contract (registration, reconnect/backoff, handler fault isolation, graceful
`SIGTERM`/`QUIT` shutdown, health properties) is **SPEC 18**.

**Handler faults are isolated but OBSERVABLE** (0.63.0). A raise or panic
in a handler body never kills the citizen (SPEC 18 §3.4) — but it no
longer disappears either: one `mix: handler fault: <command>[N]: …` line
reaches stderr, `lifecycle.health` flips to `degraded`, and
`lifecycle.handler_faults` / `lifecycle.last_fault` count and name it in
the props surface. Before 0.63.0 a faulting handler looked exactly like a
healthy one (noded reported `delivered=1` while its side effects silently
never happened).

**`lifecycle.commit` is a native hook, never a verb.** After a hot-reload
swap commits, the runtime queues one local `lifecycle.commit` event into
the new generation (see [Serve citizens](serve.md) — post-commit
handover). A wire-delivered `lifecycle.commit` is refused with `rc 10`
before any author handler and is filtered from `HELP`: an external caller
cannot run a loader's commit behaviour ahead of or behind the real commit.

A live citizen answers the standard verbs like any Rust daemon:

```mix
send statecache HELP
print("" .. $result)
```
```text
[{args: [], description: List all commands this service accepts, name: HELP}, {args: [], description: Service identity and capabilities, name: INFO}, {args: [], description: Graceful shutdown: deregister, then exit 0 (SPEC 18 §3.5), name: QUIT}, {args: [path?], description: Property snapshot at an optional path, name: statecache.props.get}, ...]
```

A minimal state-holder citizen:

```mix
-- statecache.mix — run with: mix --serve statecache.mix
$value = "(none)"

subscribe("config.current")

on config.current               -- a topic delivery updates our state
  $value = $event.body
end

on statecache.get               -- a request reads it back
  reply($value)
end
```

> A *transient* `mix <script>` (not `--serve`) can `send`/`emit` and even
> `subscribe`, but it has no service name, no reconnect, and the process ends when
> the script does — fine for one-shot orchestration drivers, not for a resident
> service.

---

## Orchestration — citizen ↔ citizen

A Mix citizen can `send`/`address` other citizens, so multi-service orchestration
is native: **pipeline** (A→B→C), **scatter-gather** (fan a request to N workers,
merge replies), **supervisor/worker**, and **review-loop** (a proposer and a
critic iterating). A driver that is its own sole caller (a cron/oneshot/CLI
invocation, no registered name) issuing sequential `send`s is correct under the
cooperative loop. The hard rule: keep the synchronous-request graph **acyclic**;
break any cycle with `emit` + topic replies (see [the deadlock note](#async-handlers-class-c)).

```mix
-- scatter-gather sketch (illustrative)
$replies = []
for each $w in ["worker.a", "worker.b", "worker.c"]
  send $w do.task input=$payload
  push($replies, $result)
end
-- merge $replies …
```

## No broker — graceful degradation

The handler uses a **lazy probe** with a small state machine, so Bus forms behave
predictably on a host that may or may not have a broker:

- **Never had a broker (`NeverPresent`).** `send` returns `nil` with `$rc = -3` (RC_UNAVAILABLE — "Bus unavailable before delivery"), `emit` is silently dropped, `port_exists` returns `false` — **no raise**, and subsequent Bus forms don't re-probe (no per-call boot cost). The same binary becomes mesh-viable the moment a broker appears.
- **Had a broker, lost the connection (`Lost`).** `send` returns `nil` with `$rc = -1` (RC_TRANSPORT) and `emit` is silently dropped — both **non-fatal**, so a mesh script survives a broker blip instead of crashing. `port_exists` **raises** `mesh unavailable: … (call bus_reconnect() to retry the probe)`.
- **`subscribe`/`unsubscribe`/`reply`** raise in *both* states — these can't be faked; a script must know they didn't happen.
- **`bus_reconnect()`** resets the probe to `Unprobed` so the next Bus form re-dials — the recovery primitive after installing a broker or after a broker bounce.

This is deliberate: `send`/`emit` stay **non-fatal in every state** (a bare host
reads `$rc = -3`, a lost broker `-1`), so a script isn't forced to guard Bus it
may never use — and because the bare-host path no longer fakes `rc=0`, a
`$rc == 0` now strictly means *delivered*. The forms that can't be faked
(`port_exists` once a broker was lost, `subscribe`/`unsubscribe`/`reply` in either
state) still raise, so a genuine outage is heard.

## Quick reference

| Form | Direction | Sets `$rc`/`$result`? | Waits? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `send t cmd k=v` | out, RPC | yes | yes (reply) |
| `$r = send t cmd` | out, RPC (expr) | yes | yes |
| `emit t cmd k=v` | out, fire-and-forget | **no** | no |
| `address t … end` | out, block of sends | yes (last line) | yes per line |
| `on cmd … end` | in, handler | — | event pump |
| `on cmd async … end` | in, Class C handler | — | yields on `send` |
| `reply(body)` / `reply(rc, body)` | answer a request | — | no |
| `subscribe(t)` / `unsubscribe(t)` | topic interest | — | yes (raises if no broker) |
| `port_exists(name)` | registry query | — | yes |
| `bus_reconnect()` | reset the probe | — | — |

Sharp edges:

- Command position matches the publisher's **inner verb**, not the topic/target.
- `emit` is a statement only (no `$x = emit …`) and sets **neither** `$rc` nor `$result`.
- Inside `address`, do **not** write `send` (each line is already a send).
- Synchronous request cycles deadlock — keep the graph acyclic.
- `send`/`emit` are **non-fatal in every failure state**: `send` writes a negative `$rc` (`-3` no broker, `-1` lost/transport, `-2` timeout) and returns `nil`, `emit` is silently dropped. `port_exists` raises once a broker was seen and lost; `subscribe`/`unsubscribe`/`reply` raise whenever the broker is unreachable.
