# syntax — lexical structure & the shell/Mix classifier

How Mix reads source: what a token is, how statements end, and the one rule that
trips up everyone coming from bash or Python — **when a line is run as Mix code
versus dispatched to the shell**. Verified against the live binary (the version
stamp is checked by `cargo test -p mix-shell --test man_pages`; ask
`mix --version` for the number).

> Mental model: Mix is a Bus-native shell where every variable carries a `$`
> sigil, concatenation is `..`, and statements are separated by a **newline or
> `;`**. At a `mix -c` one-liner or the interactive REPL, a *shell-first
> classifier* decides per input whether to evaluate it as Mix or hand it to the
> shell. That single decision explains why `$x = 1` works but `x = 1` runs a
> command called `x`.

## The five things to get right first

1. **Every variable has a `$` sigil** — `$x = 1`, never `x = 1`. A bare `x = 1` is read as a shell command (run the program `x` with args `=` and `1`).
2. **Concatenation is `..`** — `"a" .. $x`, never `.` (that's field access). `+` happens to also join strings today, but `..` is the canonical form.
3. **Statements end at a newline or `;`.** Newlines are the readable script style; `;` is the compact `mix -c` / generated-source form.
4. **`--` and `#` start a line comment.** No block comments (`/* */`).
5. **Blocks close with `end`.** No `do` keyword.

```mix
$x = 1
print($x)
```
```text
1
```

```mix
x = 1
```
```text
mix: x: No such file or directory (os error 2)
```

The second snippet isn't a Mix error at all — the classifier saw a bareword head
(`x`) and dispatched the line to the shell, which tried to exec a program named
`x`. See [the classifier](#the-shellmix-classifier) below.

## Comments

Two line-comment forms, identical behaviour: `--` (ARexx/Lua/Haskell flavour) and
`#` (shell flavour). Both run to the end of the line. There are **no block
comments** — `/* ... */` is not recognised.

Comments own the rest of their **physical line**. A semicolon inside a comment
does not resume execution: `print(1); -- note; print(2)` prints only `1`.

```mix
-- a full-line comment
$y = 2  -- a trailing comment
# also a comment, shell-style
print($y)
```
```text
2
```

Non-ASCII inside a comment is fine for the lexer, but keep comments ASCII as a
house convention.

> **`mix -c` gotcha — a leading comment line swallows the whole input.** The
> classifier trims the input and, if it *starts* with `#` or `--`, treats the
> entire `-c` argument as an empty (comment-only) line — it does **not** strip
> the first line and run the rest. So this prints nothing:
>
```text
$ mix -c '# header
print(42)'
(no output)
```
>
> Put the comment *after* the first real statement, or run from a file / stdin
> (`mix script.mix`, `mix -`), where the input is parsed as source rather than
> classified as one `-c` command. A leading comment in a script is normal.

## Statement separators — newline and `;`

This section is the authoritative `;` contract for **executable Mix**. A
semicolon is a real lexer token and the parser accepts it as a statement
separator only where a complete statement may end. It is not text substitution
for a newline and it is not an expression operator.

Use a physical newline for normal script layout and `;` when several complete
statements genuinely need to share a line — most often in `mix -c`, the REPL,
generated source, or remote Mix source:

```mix
$a = 1; $b = 2; print($a + $b)
```
```text
3
```

### Where `;` is legal

| Context | Legal? | Example / rule |
|---|---:|---|
| between top-level statements | yes | `$a = 1; print($a)` |
| after a block header or clause | yes | `if true then; print(1); else; print(0); end` |
| between statements in a function, loop, `try`, handler, or `address` body | yes | `function f(); print(1); return 2; end` |
| leading, trailing, or repeated at a statement boundary | yes, no-op | `; print(1);;` |
| inside strings, heredoc bodies, or comments | literal text | `print("a;b")`; a comment still owns its physical line |
| inside an ordinary expression container | no | calls, parentheses, lists, and maps use one expression or `,`, not `;` |
| in strict-data (`data_parse`, `load_data`, config files) | no | use newline or `,`; see [data](data.md) |

Semicolons remain visible inside `()` / `[]` / `{}`, so a nested construct with
a real statement body — an expression-position `if` or function literal — may
use them:

```mix
print(if true then; $x = 1; $x + 1; else; 0; end)  -- valid: prints 2
print((function($n); return $n + 1; end)(4))       -- valid: prints 5

print(1; 2)             -- parse error: call arguments need `,`
print((1; 2))           -- parse error: parentheses hold one expression
print([1; 2])           -- parse error: list items need `,`
print({a: 1; b: 2})     -- parse error: map entries need `,`
```

The diagnostic for the rejected forms says that `;` separates Mix statements
only. In a script/stdin source, or with a Mix-keyword head such as `print` under
`-c`/the REPL, parsing finishes before evaluation, so nothing before the error
runs. A malformed **`$`-led** `-c`/REPL input can instead trigger the historical
whole-input shell fallback; use the keyword-led forms above when checking a
diagnostic. The classifier section later on this page explains that fallback.

### Precedence and hard-boundary rule

As a statement separator, `;` binds looser than Mix statement chains and ends
the complete construct to its left:

```mix
print("a") && print("b"); print("c")
-- parsed as: (print("a") && print("b")); print("c")

print("x") | tr x y; print("z") -- `;` also ends the raw external pipeline tail
```

There is no general “pipeline before `&&`/`||`” rule in executable Mix. After a
Mix `|`, everything through newline, `;`, or end-of-input is the raw external
command tail; an `&&`/`||` there belongs to that external shell. In the other
direction, a Mix statement-chain operand may itself start a pipeline:

```mix
print("a") && print("b") | cat; print("c")
-- Mix chain first; the right operand's external tail is `cat`; `;` then starts `c`
```

Unlike a physical newline, a semicolon is a **hard** chain boundary. Mix permits
an existing `&&` / `||` chain to continue across a newline on either side of the
operator, but never across `;`:

```mix
print("a")
&& print("b")            -- valid newline continuation

print("a"); && print("b") -- parse error
print("a") &&; print("b") -- parse error
```

The lexer also suppresses newlines — but deliberately retains semicolon tokens —
inside ordinary grouping, as described below.

### Mix versus shell meaning

The separator does **not** mix the two languages. A line is classified once and
the whole line must be valid Mix or valid shell. Use `sh`, `run_argv`, or
`run_rc` for an external operation inside a Mix sequence; `print(1); echo hi`
is a Mix parse error, not “run one Mix statement then one shell command”. On an
external-command line, `;` keeps its shell command-list meaning:

```text
$ mix -c 'echo one; echo two'
one
two
```

The distinction matters for empty pieces: leading/trailing/repeated semicolons
are harmless only after the input has been classified as Mix. Shell-dispatch
accepts a single trailing `;`, but rejects a repeated/interior empty piece such
as `echo a;; echo b`. A leading `; echo x` is tried as Mix first and surfaces a
Mix parse error rather than a shell empty-piece error. See [shell mode](shell-mode.md)
for command-list classification, unknown-command preservation, and the
whole-file-first `source` caveat.

### Newlines are suppressed inside `(` `[` `{`

While the lexer is inside an open paren, bracket, or brace, newlines are
swallowed — so list/map literals and call arguments wrap freely across lines
without a continuation marker:

```mix
$nums = [
  1,
  2,
  3
]
print(length($nums))
```

```text
3
```

### Explicit line continuation: `\` at end of line

Outside a string or heredoc body, end a physical line with a backslash to
continue onto the next physical line. This works for Mix expressions and for
shell-dispatch commands in script files, `mix -c`, and the REPL:

```mix
$total = 1 + \
2 + \
3
print($total)
```
```text
6
```

```text
$ mix -c 'echo one \
two'
one two
```

The splice happens **before shell/Mix classification**, so the classifier sees
one complete logical line. This matters for operator-shaped command arguments:
`ls -d \` followed by `/tmp` stays an `ls` command instead of becoming the Mix
arithmetic expression `ls - d / tmp`.

Trailing backslashes are counted. Odd means continuation: the final backslash
and physical newline are removed, while preceding even pairs remain for the
normal parser. Thus `\` continues, `\\` is a literal backslash, and `\\\` is
one literal backslash plus continuation.

A continuation marker at EOF is typed incomplete input. The REPL retains its
accumulator; a file or `-c` invocation exits non-zero. Backslashes inside Mix
single/double-quoted strings and heredoc bodies are not continuation markers,
so Windows-style strings such as `"C:\\path"` and command text passed through
`run` or `sh` keep their existing shell-owned escaping.

### Concat continuation: trailing `..`

The concat operator also continues its expression when `..` ends a physical
line. Blank lines and comment-only lines may appear before the right operand:

```mix
$message = "a long prefix: " .. -- explain the next fragment

  "middle" ..
  " and suffix"
print($message)
```

This is deliberately **trailing-only**. A `..` at the start of a line does not
reattach to the previous statement, and `../path` keeps its existing relative
path meaning in shell commands and in `source` / `include`. A semicolon remains
a hard statement boundary. Use trailing `\` for general continuation after any
other operator; no other binary operator gains this newline rule.

## Blocks close with `end` — no `do`

Every compound form (`if`, `for`, `while`, `function`/`fn`, `on`, `try`) is closed
by `end`. There is **no `do` keyword**: since 0.98.0 `do` is reserved and
**refused with a parse error** — `unexpected do — Mix has no do keyword;
blocks close with end`. Before 0.98.0 a stray `do` was silently absorbed
as a bare-identifier no-op — the bash reflex ran, and meant nothing. (A few
legacy terminators — `next` for loops, `done` for `while`/`loop`/`on` — still
parse with a deprecation warning; `if` and `function`/`fn` accept **only** `end`.
Prefer `end` everywhere.) Full grammar of each block lives in
[control flow](control-flow.md) and [functions](functions.md).

```mix
$n = 3
if $n > 0 then
  print("positive")
end
```
```text
positive
```

## Tokens the lexer produces

### Numbers — f64, with radix literals

Mix has a single numeric type (f64). Decimal, plus `0x` hex / `0o` octal / `0b`
binary integer literals (sugar for the f64 value — handy for file modes and
bitmasks). Underscores are allowed as digit separators. Scientific notation is
accepted: `[eE][+-]?digits` — `1e6`, `1.5e3`, `2e-3`, `1E3`. The `e`/`E` is only
consumed when a digit follows, so the Euler builtin in `2 * e()` is never eaten.

```mix
print(0o755)
print(0xFF)
print(0b101)
print(1e6)
print(2e-3)
```
```text
493
255
5
1000000
0.002
```

A **bare leading-zero integer is a lex error** — `0755` is rejected so a file
mode can't silently become decimal `755`. The error is surfaced, not masked:

```mix
0755
```
```text
Lexer error at line 1:1: ambiguous leading-zero number '0755' — use a 0o (octal) / 0x (hex) / 0b (binary) prefix, or drop the leading zero(s) for decimal
```

Plain `0`, and genuine fractions like `0.5`, are unaffected, and `0e5` is a
valid `0` — but `07e2` still errors (the leading-zero check runs before the
exponent). This is a *Mix number-literal* hazard only: inside a shell-out the
arg is a string, so `run("install -m 0755 a b")` is fine. Full numeric
semantics live in [numbers](numbers.md).

### Strings — `'raw'` vs `"interpolated"`

Two forms, bash-style. Full coverage in [strings](strings.md); the lexical facts:

- `'single'` is **fully raw** — no interpolation, no `~` expansion (only `\'` and `\\` escapes).
- `"double"` interpolates **`${name}`** (scope → env), expands a **leading `~`** to `$HOME`, and honours `\n \t \r \e \\ \" \$ \~` and `\u{XXXX}` escapes.
- In double quotes a **bare `$name` is literal text** (the opposite of bash), and **`$(...)` is literal** — the build-time-substitution footgun was removed.

```mix
$name = "Ada"
print("hi $name")
print("hi ${name}")
print('hi ${name}')
print("~/code")               -- a LEADING ~ expands to $HOME
print("home is ~/code")       -- a mid-string ~ stays literal
```
```text
hi $name
hi Ada
hi ${name}
/home/user/code
home is ~/code
```

### Variables — the `$` sigil

A variable token is `$` followed by `[A-Za-z0-9_]+`. Reading an **unbound** sigil
raises a runtime error (positional `$1`/`$2` script args are exempt):

```mix
print($undefined)
```
```text
Runtime error at line 1: undefined variable '$undefined'
```

### Operators & delimiters

```text
arithmetic   +  -  *  /  %  **            (** is power: 2 ** 10 -> 1024)
concat       ..                            ("a" .. $x)
compare      ==  !=  <  <=  >  >=  eq  ne  (eq/ne are keyword string-equality ops)
logical      and  or  not                  (keywords, not && / ! in expressions)
nil-coalesce ??                            ($x ?? "default")
ternary      ?  :                          ($n > 0 ? "pos" : "neg")
field/index  .  []                         ($m.key  /  $m["key"])
grouping     (  )   [  ]   {  }
statement    ;                              (hard statement boundary; see above)
misc         :  ,  =  ~                     (: in maps, = assignment, ~ path tilde)
```

`??` returns its right side when the left is `nil`:

```mix
$x = nil
print($x ?? "default")
```
```text
default
```

`**` is power; `..` is concat (not a range). A lone `?` is the ternary
`cond ? a : b` token (see [operators](operators.md) for precedence and the
if-expression form). A lone `&` is a lex error *with a hint*:

```mix
print(1 & 2)
```
```text
Lexer error at line 1:9: unexpected '&', did you mean '&&'?
```

### Heredocs — `<<TAG`

`<<TAG` opens a heredoc; the body runs to a line containing only `TAG`. Unlike a
double-quoted string, a heredoc body **does** interpolate `${var}` *and* run
`$(command)` substitution. See [strings](strings.md) for the full treatment.

### Keywords — reserved as identifiers, usable as names

Identifiers matching a keyword become that keyword token. The complete set is
printed by `mix keywords` and each resolves via `mix what NAME` — the binary
is the oracle, and the manual's table ([keywords](keywords.md)) is held to the
same lexer set by the build, so the list is never enumerated here where it
could rot.

Keywords **cannot** be function names or bare user identifiers:

```mix
function step($x) return $x end
```
```text
Parse error at line 1:10: expected identifier, got Step
```

But since 0.21 a keyword **is accepted anywhere it is unambiguously a NAME** —
the old "quote every reserved-word key" footgun is retired:

- **Bare map keys**: `{ label: 1, to: "x", on: true, parse: 2 }` parses.
- **Field access & assignment**: `$m.to`, `$r.label`, `$cfg.to = 1`. An assignment target may chain accessors freely since 0.33.0 — `$cfg.server.host = "x"`, `$m[$u]["k"] = 1`, `$l[0][1] = 9` (see `mix man collections`).
- **Strict-data `.conf.mix` keys**: a key named `to`/`in`/`on`/`label` needs no quoting.
- **`send`/`emit`/`address` kwargs**: `send maild mailbox.move to=$dest` parses (keyword + `=` is a named arg).
- **`parse … with` delimiter words**: `parse $s with $a to $b` uses the literal word `to` as the delimiter — EXCEPT the block/branch terminator set (`end` `else` `catch` `when` `otherwise` `done` `next`), which still ends an inline `parse` statement first.
- **Sigil variables were never restricted**: `$to`, `$label`, even `$fn` are ordinary variables — the lexer reads the name after `$` as a variable token, never a keyword.

```mix
$m = { label: 1, to: "x" }
print($m.to)
$m.label = 9
print($m.label)
```
```text
x
9
```

**The one exception is `fn`** — it lexes to the *same token* as `function`, so
the original spelling is unrecoverable and a bare `fn` key/field still errors.
Quote the key and use index access:

```mix
$m = { fn: 1 }
```
```text
Parse error at line 1:8: expected identifier, got Function
```

```mix
$m = { "fn": 1 }
print($m["fn"])
```
```text
1
```

### Parser nesting cap — depth 200

The parser caps recursive nesting (parens, deep `if` chains, nested maps/lists)
at **depth 200**, matching the evaluator's recursion cap — a pathological
`((((…` input gets a clean parse error, never a stack-overflow abort:

```text
$ mix -c 'print((((( … 205 deep … )))))'
Parse error at line 1:202: nesting too deep (limit 200)
```

## The shell/Mix classifier

At a `mix -c '<line>'` one-liner, the interactive REPL, and a mix login shell, Mix
follows the universal shell `-c` contract: it is **shell-first**. Each input is
classified once into one of: **Mix code**, **external command**, **empty**,
**incomplete**, or **parse-error**. The decision rests almost entirely on the
**first word** (after alias expansion and after skipping any leading `KEY=VALUE`
env prefixes).

The order of checks (from `shell.rs`):

1. **Empty / comment** — blank, or trimmed input starting with `#` or `--` → *empty*, runs nothing.
2. **`$`-led line** → **Mix** (with a shell-chain fallback). A line beginning with `$` is your variable work.
3. **First word is a Mix keyword** (`if for while loop function fn return select print eprint die try parse export alias break continue send address emit source sh label`) → **Mix**. Note `true`/`false`/`nil` are deliberately **not** in this list: as a line *head* they are shell commands, so a bare `false` at the prompt runs `/usr/bin/false` and exits **1** like every shell. The lexer still owns the literals inside Mix source (`$x = true`, `if $a == nil`); `nil` has no external binary, so it falls through to the Mix parse anyway.
4. **First word is a REPL shell builtin** (`cd pushd popd history exit which type unalias jobs fg bg mix`) → **external command**. (A plain foreground `cd` also works inside `&&`/`||`/`;` chains — `cd /tmp && pwd` is intercepted in-process; see [shell-mode](shell-mode.md).)
5. **First word is a tight-hyphenated command shape** (`mixos-comp`, `systemd-nspawn`, `weston-simple-dmabuf-egl`) → **external command**, whether or not it is on `$PATH`. This applies only to the statement head: it must start with an ASCII letter or `_`, contain a `-` with no surrounding whitespace, end with an ASCII letter/digit/`_`, and otherwise contain only ASCII letters/digits/`_`/`-`.
6. **First word is found on `$PATH` or is a path** (`/`, `./`, `~/…`) → **external command** (the shell-first principle). If the head is a real program but the command line is malformed (e.g. a bad redirect), the shell tokenizer's error is surfaced.
7. **Otherwise** → try to parse as **Mix**. If that parse succeeds it's Mix code; if it fails, a tie-break decides whether to surface the real Mix lex/parse error or report "command not found".

So the `$` sigil isn't decoration — it is what routes assignment to the Mix
evaluator instead of the shell:

```mix
$greeting = "hi there"
print($greeting)
```
```text
hi there
```

A parenthesized call is unambiguously Mix:

```mix
print(1 + 1)
```
```text
2
```

A bareword head that lives on `$PATH` is a shell command:

```text
$ mix -c 'echo hello from shell'
hello from shell
```

A tight hyphen keeps a command name whole before the Mix parser can read it as
subtraction. PATH membership is not required, so a typo still names the complete
command and exits 127:

```text
$ mix -c 'mixos-comp --nested'       # runs one command named mixos-comp
$ mix -c 'alpha-no-such-command'
mix: alpha-no-such-command: No such file or directory (os error 2)
```

The rule is deliberately statement-head-only. Whitespace or an expression
marker makes subtraction explicit, so all of these stay Mix:

```mix
a - b
$a - $b
1 - 2
$x-1
$a-$b
print(alpha-beta)       -- hyphen is inside a call, not the line head
```

Scope never changes this decision. Bare `alpha` is the string `"alpha"`, not a
reference to `$alpha`, so `alpha-beta` is a command even when `$alpha` is live.
Working variable subtraction is sigil-led (`$alpha-$beta`) and stays Mix.
Earlier exact head rules still win, so `mix not-a-command` remains the `mix`
meta-command with one hyphenated argument, not a command named
`not-a-command`.

There is one other position where a tight hyphen is read whole rather than as
subtraction, for the same reason: the TARGET of
[`send`/`emit`/`address`](bus.md), where hyphenated Bus service names
(`comp-nested`, `desktop-vt1`) are the norm. The shape there is this one plus
`.`, for dotted names. It is a target-position rule, not a second
statement-head rule — everything in the list above is unaffected.

A `KEY=VALUE` prefix is skipped to find the real head — this is an *external
command* with an env var set for it:

```text
$ mix -c 'FOO=bar printenv FOO'
bar
```

### The tie-break: real Mix error vs "command not found"

After the tight-hyphen check, when the head is **not** on `$PATH` and the Mix
parse **fails**, Mix inspects the head's shape (only the first word — a later
character can't flip the verdict):

- A **bareword / path-like** head (`gti status`, `./build`, `foo:bar`) is a command target → reports the familiar command-not-found:

```text
$ mix -c 'gti status'
mix: gti: No such file or directory (os error 2)
```

- A **Mix-expression** head (a number, an operator, a `$`, or a call/index opener like `print(`) was meant as Mix → surfaces the real lex/parse error instead of masking it as a missing binary:

```text
$ mix -c 'print(0755)'
Lexer error at line 1:7: ambiguous leading-zero number '0755' — use a 0o (octal) / 0x (hex) / 0b (binary) prefix, or drop the leading zero(s) for decimal
```

This is why `print(0755)` tells you about the bad number rather than "No such
file `print(0755)`".

### Shell chaining vs Mix chaining

`&&` / `||` / `;` on an **external-command** line are shell operators (command
lists) — `true`/`false` heads are external commands, so `true && echo yes` and
`false || echo fallback` are plain shell chains. On a **Mix-keyword or `$`-led**
line, Mix's own grammar owns `&&` / `||` and `;`, so a valid Mix
chain stays Mix. A keyword/`$` head that *fails* Mix parse **and** is a genuine
multi-command shell list normally falls back to the shell (e.g.
`send oops ; echo hi` runs as a two-command shell list); definitive language
errors such as an assignment-led chain do not. Mix-keyword heads never
reach the command-not-found tie-break — they route through the Mix-then-shell
path, so a keyword-led line that fails both surfaces its Mix error
(`print(1); echo hi` reports a Mix parse error, not "command not found").

In a **Mix-classified** chain, an assignment cannot be any operand of `&&` or
`||`, whether first, middle or last. Since these are statement-chain operators,
accepting `$ok = $a.ok && $b.ok` would assign only `$a.ok`, while
`print("gate") && $ok = false || print("fallback")` can conceal the falsy
assignment behind a successful statement chain. Mix rejects every such shape as
`MIX-E1002`, and the line's own operands never run. Use `and` / `or` inside the
assigned expression for logical values, or split the assignment and command
chain into two statements if shell-style conditional execution was intended.
This applies to variable, field, index and nested-path assignments, to the
value-binding `export x = v`, `alias n = c` and terse `function f() = expr`
forms, and to all of them inside nested statement bodies. The forms that bind
no `=` expression stay legal operands: `alias` in its query and list forms, and
the block-bodied `function f() … end`.

Once a line is rejected it stays rejected: the error never falls back to shell
execution under `mix -c`, `source`, or `~/.mixrc` loading.

The qualifier "Mix-classified" is load-bearing. Two conditions must **both**
hold before a line carrying an assignment keeps shell semantics:

1. the classifier routes the line to the shell — either straight off the head
   (a path, a name on `PATH`, a shell builtin), or through one of the
   fallbacks that reconsider a line whose Mix parse failed and which is
   structurally a shell command list (a shell redirect; an env prefix in
   front of a keyword head like `export`); and
2. the Mix parse never reaches the assignment, so the typed
   assignment-chain error is never constructed.

Where both hold, the line behaves as `bash` does with it: `$x = false` is
three shell words whose `$x` expands, the failed `=` command is reported on
stderr, and `||` fires. That covers a path-shaped head (`/usr/bin/true && $x =
false || cmd` fails the Mix parse at `unexpected token Slash`), a shell
redirect (`zqxfoo > /dev/null; $x = false || cmd`), and an env prefix
(`FOO=bar export x = false || cmd`). Adding a redirect or an env prefix to an
otherwise-rejected line therefore turns it from a Mix error into a shell
command list — a consequence of where the parse gives out, not a guarantee
that assignments are honoured there.

Neither condition is sufficient alone. **Failing to parse as Mix does not by
itself send a line to the shell**: `print(1); echo hi` and `$x = (((` are both
parse errors that stay Mix errors, because a call head and a `$` head are
never routed to the shell. And a head being a shell command is not enough
either — `true && $x = false || cmd` has a head that is both a `PATH` binary
and a valid Mix literal, so the parse reaches the assignment and condition 2
fails. Once the parser has typed this error no head rule may reclassify the
line; the same holds for a tight-hyphenated head (`zqx-foo && …`) and for
`cd`. Those head rules still decide every line that does *not* carry a
rejected assignment, so `mixos-comp --nested` and `true && cmd` remain shell
as before. In a mixed sourced file, earlier shell lines execute normally
before a later line's rejection aborts the `source`.

One asymmetry predates this rule and is unchanged by it: the tight-hyphen head
discriminator exists only in the `mix -c`/REPL classifier. A `source`d file
reads `mixos-comp --nested` as the subtraction `"mixos" - "comp"` (the
option becomes a comment) and fails with `cannot use 'mixos' as number` —
whether the file parses whole or falls back to per-line handling. Give such a
head its full path (`/usr/bin/mixos-comp --nested`). Quoting it does **not**
work: `"mixos-comp" --nested` is a discarded string followed by a comment, so
the command silently never runs.

```mix
$ok = $a.ok and $b.ok       -- logical value: valid
$value = primary() ?? fallback() -- nil fallback: valid
$ok = $a.ok && $b.ok        -- parse error: assignment cannot be chained
print("gate") && $ok = false -- same parse error; nothing prints
```

```text
$ mix -c 'true && echo yes'
yes
$ mix -c 'false || echo fallback'
fallback
```

The full set of shell-dispatch syntax — pipes, redirects, `$(...)` command
substitution, brace expansion — is documented in [shell-mode](shell-mode.md).
Those apply only on a line the classifier routed to the shell; inside Mix *source*
they are inert (`$(...)` is literal text, `{a,b}` is a map/string) — except
inside a heredoc body, which does interpolate `$(...)`.

### Running scripts vs one-liners

- `mix script.mix` / `mix -` (stdin) — normally a whole-file Mix **script** (`echo hi` remains a Mix parse error). An explicitly continued command line is the narrow exception: its physical lines are assembled, then the complete logical line enters the strict classifier fallback.
- `mix -c '<line>'` — a one-liner: the **whole argument** is classified as one unit (hence the leading-comment gotcha above). Use `;` or real newlines for multiple Mix statements.
- `mix -i -c '<line>'` — interactive flavour: loads `~/.mixrc` (aliases + PATH) before classifying, so an aliased head resolves.
