# mix lint — semantic analysis

`mix --check` is a syntax check: it lexes and parses, nothing more. It happily
passes a script that reads an undefined variable, calls a function that exists
nowhere, or hands `substr` one argument. `mix lint` (0.29.0) is the semantic
layer: it builds the scope universe, resolves every call against the builtin
contract metadata and the file's own definitions, and reports machine-readable
diagnostics with **stable codes** — designed for an agent to consume without
parsing prose, and biased hard toward zero false positives on Mix's dynamic
seams.

```text
mix lint [--json | --data] [--deny-warnings] [--require-version]
         [--allow-global NAME]... [--allow-function NAME]...
         FILE...
```

- Exit codes: `0` no errors (warnings allowed unless `--deny-warnings`); `1` one or more errors, or any warning under `--deny-warnings`; `2` invalid usage, unreadable input, or internal failure. **Notes never affect the exit code** — a file whose only findings are notes exits `0` even under `--deny-warnings` (0.63.0; pinned by CLI tests, because `--deny-warnings` is a live fleet deploy gate).
- Diagnostics go to **stdout**; CLI errors go to **stderr**. `--deny-warnings` changes only the exit decision, never a severity.
- `--require-version` (0.95.0) reports `MIX-D3016` (a script with no `-- version:` header) as a **warning** instead of a note — the one flag that moves a severity, and only for that code. Pair it with `--deny-warnings` to make a missing header fail a gate.
- `-` reads stdin (at most once); relative `require()` paths from stdin resolve against the current directory.
- `--allow-global NAME` / `--allow-function NAME` declare names an embedder or environment provides (repeatable).
- If script parsing fails, lint tries the same strict-data parser as `load_data()`.
  A successful fallback exits cleanly and prints `validated as strict data (not
  as a script)`. If both parsers fail, an explicit top-level `key:` shape (or a
  conventional strict-data suffix as a tiebreak) gets the data error;
  otherwise the original script error is preserved.

## The rules (v1)

Codes are permanent — never reused, never repurposed — from three
namespaces: `MIX-E1xxx` errors, `MIX-W2xxx` warnings (born warnings), and
`MIX-D3xxx` **deprecations and release-transition advisories** (0.63.0) —
a severity-*independent* namespace: a deprecation starts at severity
`note` and may later be promoted to `warning` with the **code unchanged**
(only the wire `severity` field moves), so tooling that suppresses or
greps by code keeps working across the promotion.

### Notes (severity `note`, 0.63.0)

Rendered with a `note:` prefix, sorted after errors and warnings, counted
in their own summary field, and **never** gating. Current D-codes:

| code | what it flags |
|---|---|
| `MIX-D3001`–`D3005` | the five pattern-first legacy names `regex_match regex_find regex_replace regex_split grep` — use the subject-first `re_match re_find re_replace re_split grep_lines`. **The legacy names were DELETED in release B (0.73.0)** after the fleet-wide inventory read zero, so a surviving call also gets `MIX-E1102` (undefined function) and fails at runtime; these notes stay as the pointer to the replacement |
| ~~`MIX-D3006`~~ | **RETIRED in 0.68.0.** Watch note for the map-binding flip, which has landed: a two-variable loop over a MAP now binds (key, value). Code permanently spent, never reused |
| ~~`MIX-D3007`~~ | **RETIRED in 0.68.0.** Watch note for the equality flip, which has landed: `==`/`!=` with a map or list on **both** sides now raises `TYPE_ERROR` naming `deep_eq`. The shipped rule is narrower than this note's "either operand" wording — a collection compared to a *scalar* still answers, so `$m[$k] == nil` keeps working. Code permanently spent, never reused |
| `MIX-D3012` | an **`ssh_mix` body that could not be analysed** (0.69.0) — a non-literal second argument (a variable, a concatenation, an interpolated string, a `read_file`), or a literal that does not parse as Mix. Says so explicitly rather than passing silently, because an unreadable body counted as clean is exactly how an inventory reads zero while live sites exist |
| `MIX-D3008`–`D3011` | the REXX-style `pos lastpos byte_pos byte_lastpos` family, declared legacy — with a sharper message when composed as `substr(.., pos(..))` in one expression (the 1-based/0-based off-by-one). These stay notes until their own fleet count reads zero; they are NOT deleted in release B |
| `MIX-D3014` | **`write_file()` of an unchecked `replace()` result** (0.90.0) — the edit-a-file idiom with nothing anywhere in the file that could have noticed the needle was absent. `replace()` returns the subject unchanged when it misses, so the input is written straight back and the run reports success. Use `replace_must()`/`re_replace_must()`, which raise `NEEDLE_ABSENT` (and assert the site count with `{count: n}`). Conservative: only a `write_file` whose written value is a replace call or a variable the same straight-line block assigned from one, and any guard spelling anywhere in the file (`contains`, `pos`, `index_of`, `count_of`, `re_match`, a `_must` twin) silences it for the whole file |
| `MIX-D3013` | a **hand-rolled padding loop** (0.74.0) — `while len($o) < $n … $o = $o .. " "` — pointing at `lpad`/`rpad` (and the display-cell `lpad_w`/`rpad_w`). Four independent sessions wrote this loop while the builtins sat in the binary; the note is the discoverability fix that reaches the author at authoring time. Narrow by design: only a `<`/`<=` comparison of `len`/`length` of the same variable the body self-appends a string literal to |
| `MIX-D3016` | a **script with no `-- version: X.Y.Z` header** in its leading comment region (within the first 32 lines) (0.95.0), so [`mix SCRIPT --version`](invocation.md#--version-for-scripts) and `script_version()` can only say `unversioned` — every binary and every Mix script answers `--version` (Mark, 2026-09-25). Emitted by the lint driver, only for files **run as scripts**, decided by a deliberately simple heuristic over the path *as given*, in this order: (1) line 1 is a `#!` shebang — a script; (2) a `lib`, `_lib`, `tests` or `test` directory component — never reported: a library is loaded by `require`, and a test script must stay header-less, because a header would make it the entry script whose record `script_version()` returns; (3) a `bin`, `_bin`, `scripts` or `build` directory component — a script; (4) a serve citizen — a top-level `on <verb>` handler at column 0, or `--serve` mentioned in the leading comment region. `mix lint deploy.mix` from inside `_bin/` has no directory component, so lint from the repo root. Known false positive, Wontfix: a library under an absolute `/…/bin/…` path with no `lib` component is reported. The mirror holds too: any `/…/lib/…` or `/…/tests/…` ancestor in an absolute path exempts a script beneath it. Only the leading comment region counts as the header (see [invocation](invocation.md#--version-for-scripts)), so a `-- version:` inside a heredoc does not satisfy it. A header line whose value is not `X.Y.Z` is reported on its own line, since the runtime treats it as absent. A note by default; `--require-version` makes it a warning, code unchanged |
| `MIX-D3017` | an **unprovable variable read inside an `ssh_mix` body with dynamic bindings** — the name is bound nowhere in the body, but the call's opts are unreadable so `bindings`/`env` may supply it at runtime, and it is NOT an error. Fires only when the name is one edit away from something the body DOES bind (a parameter or local), where the typo is the likelier explanation: `'$pott' … did you mean '$port'?` One edit is one edit — an adjacent transposition (`$prot`) is TWO under plain Levenshtein, and the short-name budget stays at one so unrelated dynamic bindings keep their silence. A name with no near neighbour is an ordinary dynamic binding and stays silent |
| `MIX-D3018` | **`ssh_mix` opts are not a statically readable map** — the injected names are unknown, so undefined-**variable** checks stand down for that body (dynamic bindings may supply any free DATA name). The boundary is split, not blanket: undefined-**function** checks still run (strict-data bindings cannot create a callable, so a function name the body does not define is undefined no matter what the opts hold). A variable bound exactly once to a map literal IS resolved (`$o = {bindings: {…}}`), so the fleet opts-variable shape keeps full checks |
| `MIX-D3015` | a **bare `$NAME` in a double-quoted string** (0.90.0) where `NAME` is bound in the same file. Double quotes interpolate `${NAME}` only; the bare form is literal BY DESIGN, which is the opposite of bash — four occurrences in one file passed lint and all four failed at runtime. `\$NAME` and a single-quoted `'…'` string are the two clean spellings and neither is reported. The lexer drops the whole batch for a MULTI-LINE string and for one whose spelling contains `\"`: both mark NESTED source (an `ssh_mix` body, a `mix -c` program), where a bare `$rc` is the inner program's variable and correctly literal. A **note** where the heredoc twin `MIX-W2402` is a warning, and the asymmetry is measured — over 785 fleet scripts W2402 costs 4 findings and this one an order of magnitude more even after those exclusions, so a warning would fail `--deny-warnings` on scripts that are not wrong. D3xxx is the promotable namespace precisely so that can change once the residue is worked off |

Member-call spellings are covered too: a builtin-named `.name(` desugars
to the same call at parse time.

```

`MIX-W2403` is **retired** (0.90.0), never reused: the builtin-shadowing
definition check was promoted from warning to error and therefore had to
move, since a code's letter fixes its severity permanently. It is now
`MIX-E1303`.

- **MIX-E1003** means the source was recognisably intended as strict data but
  failed the literal-data grammar. It is distinct from a broken executable
  script (`MIX-E1002`). A valid data file under any filename is recognised by
  content; the suffix is only a tiebreak when neither grammar succeeds.
- **MIX-E1101** flags a `$name` read only when the name is bound **nowhere in its visible universe** — function bodies see params + their own binders + everything bound anywhere at file level (Mix has no block scoping and no read-before-assign rule, so lexical order is deliberately ignored). `${name}` interpolation is never flagged (it falls back to the process environment), nor are `$1`-style positionals or the runtime-injected `rc` / `result` / `status` / `event` / `_`.
- **MIX-E1102** resolves bareword calls against builtins, HOFs, evaluator special forms, every `function` definition in the file, the embedded prelude, `--allow-function` names, AND any assigned variable (a bareword call can dispatch to a function-valued variable). Calls inside `address ... end` blocks are sends and are never flagged; `MethodCall`/`ValueCall` are dynamic dispatch and are skipped. The hint carries the **same "did you mean" the runtime prints** for that name. One suggester serves both, so lint (where an agent looks first) and the failing run cannot disagree. It checks, in order: the deleted-name pointers (`regex_match` → `re_match(s, pattern)`), then the **form table** for the foreign get/set/find whose answer is Mix syntax, not a builtin name (`get` → `$m[key]` / `get_or`/`require_key`; `set` → `$m[key] = value`; `find` → `index_of`/`filter`, semantics as in [collections](collections.md) — range inclusive, `sort` numeric-then-lexicographic, `filter` list-first), then a **foreign-name synonym table** for the names a python/bash/JS habit reaches for first (`json_decode`/`json_loads` → `json_parse`, `json_dumps` → `json_encode`, `str` → `to_string`, `trim_end`/`rstrip` → `rtrim`, `len_bytes` → `byte_length`, `getenv` → `env`, …), and only then edit distance. The order matters: `json_encode` is the nearest spelling of `json_decode` and means the opposite. A user-defined `fn get/set/find` is a known callable and never reaches the suggester.
- **MIX-E1201** checks calls against the structured contract metadata (`mix builtins --json`), including non-contiguous exact-arity sets — `random(1)` is an error, `random()`/`random(min, max)` are not. The contract is the documented surface; some older builtins tolerate surplus arguments at runtime, and lint is deliberately stricter (`mix --strict-arity` makes the runtime agree).
- **MIX-E1203** (0.103.3) flags a literal argument whose type cannot satisfy the contract's declared shape — `mkdir({a: 1})`, `exists([1, 2])`, `len(3)`. The runtime raises TYPE_MISMATCH on the same call (0.103.1), so the rule makes lint agree with the runtime; a wrong-typed path/target literal is a side effect on the wrong target. Variables and expressions are not judged — only a literal proves the type. A literal `nil` is judged too: it satisfies only a shape that declares it (`any_of(…, nil)` for the optional args that treat nil as omission, or `any`), so `write_file(nil, "x")` is flagged exactly as the runtime refuses it.
- **MIX-E1501** flags a discarded `push`/`pop`/`shift` whose first argument is **not a bare variable** — `push($m["a"], $v)`, `push($m.a, $v)`, `$m["a"].push($v)`. These builtins mutate through the variable slot, so given any other expression they append to a temporary copy and the write is **lost in silence**. It is an ERROR, not a warning: the statement does nothing while reading as though it did. The fix **differs by builtin**: `push` returns the appended list, so assign it back (`$m["a"] = push($m["a"], $v)`); `pop`/`shift` return the **removed element**, not the list, so assigning that back replaces the list with the element (data corruption) — hoist first instead (`$l = $m[$k]; $x = pop($l); $m[$k] = $l`). For maps of maps, write the [nested assignment](collections.md) directly. A by-value **parameter** is a bare variable, so that case stays with its own definition-time dead-push warning and is not double-reported.
- **MIX-E1502** flags a discarded `delete` / `merge` — both are **pure** (they return a new container and change nothing in place), so a bare call is a no-op. Assign it back: `$m = delete($m, "k")`.
- **MIX-E1503–E1506** are the `--agent` profile (run `mix lint --agent`, or `MIX_LINT=agent`): a function name stored as a value (`$f = bump` binds the *string*), an assignment from a nil-returning builtin (`$n = write_file(...)` binds nil), a constant-truthy condition (`if "false"`, a bare process-result map — `while true` is exempt), and a `fn` body writing an outer variable (which silently creates a local). Ordinary lint and the fleet's `--deny-warnings` gates run without them.
- **MIX-W2201** fires when an operation whose failure signal lives in its RETURN VALUE (`effects.must_use`: `run_rc`, `run_argv`, `run_pipeline`, `run_parallel`, `ssh_run`, `ssh_exec`, `ssh_mix`, `http_*`, `kill`, `run_stream`) is a bare expression statement — the bug class where a failed remote step silently vanishes. Bind the result and branch on it; some have a fail-fast twin that raises (`run_argv`→`run_argv_must`, `run_pipeline`→`run_pipeline_must`, `ssh_run`→`ssh_must`). The last statement of a block is exempt (it may be the block's value).
- **MIX-W2301** warns that `+` is not defined for lists or maps. Since 0.90.0
  the runtime **raises** `TYPE_ERROR` there rather than silently stringifying,
  so this fires ahead of the run for a list/map **literal** operand, or a
  variable proven by straight-line analysis to hold a directly assigned one —
  which is the only gate there is on an `ssh_mix` body, or on a branch a local
  run never takes. Use `concat(a, b)` for lists, `merge(a, b)` for maps,
  `push(list, value)` to append, `..` to build text. It stays a *warning*, not
  an error: the proven-value facts are straight-line, so a reassigned variable
  can make the prediction wrong.
- **MIX-W2302** warns when the result of a uniquely defined named function is
  consumed, its block body's final statement is a bare expression, and the
  body contains no value-returning `return`. Block functions implicitly return
  `nil`; add `return`. A discarded call is quiet, as are mixed-return bodies,
  terminating final expressions, and calls whose name can be redirected
  through a variable.
- **MIX-W2303** is defence-in-depth for Rust embedders that construct the public
  AST directly and pass it to `analyze()`: it warns if any operand of a
  hand-built `StmtKind::Chain` is an assignment. Ordinary Mix source cannot
  reach this warning because the parser rejects the same shape first as
  `MIX-E1002`. The code remains reserved for this public-API path and is not
  repurposed.
- **MIX-W2304** checks a literal field/index key against the builtin's
  documented result-map fields from `mix builtins --json`. It works on a
  direct builtin call or a variable proven by straight-line assignment to
  hold that result. The hint names the closest documented key (for example,
  `exit_code` rather than `code`). Dynamic keys, generic maps and result
  shapes without declared fields are deliberately silent.
- **MIX-W2305** flags `index_of()` / `byte_index_of()` / `bytes_find()` (added
  v0.64.0) used **bare as a truth
  value**. They return `-1` for "not found" and `0` for "found at the first
  position", and Mix treats `0` as falsy and every non-zero number — `-1`
  included — as truthy. So a bare call in a condition is wrong on *both*
  branches:

  ```mix
  if index_of("abc", "z") then …   -- -1 is TRUTHY  → absent reads as present
  if index_of("abc", "a") then …   --  0 is FALSY   → found-at-0 reads as absent
  ```

  Compare explicitly (`index_of(..) >= 0`), or use `contains()` for the yes/no
  question — **except for `byte_find`/`bytes_find`**, whose bytes subject
  `contains()` rejects, so those take the `>= 0` comparison only. Their 1-based
  twins — `pos`, `lastpos`, `byte_pos`,
  `byte_lastpos` — are **safe** in the same position because their not-found
  sentinel is `0` and therefore falsy; that asymmetry is exactly what makes
  the trap easy to walk into, and why the rule exists. Fires in `if`/`elif`,
  `while`, `break if`/`continue if`, expression-position `if`, the ternary
  condition, and through `not`/`and`/`or`. Any explicit comparison is already
  correct code and stays silent.
- **MIX-W2306** flags a literal command passed to `ssh_run` or `ssh_must` when
  its source spelling contains `\"`. That escape is the high-signal mark of
  nested Mix source which the remote shell will parse again. Ship the source
  verbatim with [`ssh_mix` + a heredoc](remote.md#headline-idiom-ssh_mix--heredoc).
  Simple command strings, computed commands, `ssh_exec`, `ssh_mix`, and
  single-quoted strings containing ordinary `"` stay quiet.
- **MIX-W2311** warns on a direct, unshadowed [`fmt()`/`sprintf()`](strings.md#sprintf--c-compatible-formatting-v0710)
  call whose template is a string literal that parses cleanly under the
  runtime grammar, when the call provides more operands than the template
  consumes — `fmt("%s", 1, 2)` provides two operands for one placeholder,
  and both builtins **silently ignore** the surplus (they are variadic, so
  the generic arity gate cannot see it). `%%` consumes nothing; a `*` width
  and a `sprintf` `.*` precision consume one operand each, so `fmt("%*s",
  5, "x")` is exact and stays quiet. Invalid or unknown templates (which
  would raise at runtime), dynamically built templates, deficits (the
  runtime's own "not enough arguments" error), and calls a user function,
  variable, `address` block or `source`/`include` could shadow are silent
  too.
- **MIX-W2401**: one `source`/`include` anywhere disables the undefined-name checks for the whole file (the loaded file can define anything) — reported once so you know analysis is degraded. Prefer `require()`: it is isolated, statically resolvable, and E1401/E1402 verify literal-path modules parse.
- **MIX-W2402** warns when a heredoc literal contains bare `$NAME` and `NAME` is bound somewhere in the same visible universe. Heredocs interpolate `${NAME}`, not `$NAME`, so the bare form often means a generated config was silently corrupted. It does not fire for `${NAME}`, `$(` command substitution, explicitly escaped `\$NAME`, all-digit names such as `$1`, unknown names, or ordinary double-quoted strings. The warning is lint-only: bare `$NAME` still evaluates to literal `$NAME`, and intentional literal output requires no change. In a heredoc that ships as an `ssh_mix` body it stays silent for the names the **remote** program owns: the call's `bindings`/`env` keys and whatever the body binds itself. There, bare is exactly right, and `${NAME}` would splice the local value into the remote source. Any other bound name still warns.
- **MIX-E1303** (0.90.0; was `MIX-W2403` from 0.74.0) errors at the *definition* of a function whose name is a builtin: the builtin wins at every call site (a builtin-named dot-call even desugars at parse time), so the definition is unreachable by name — only an extracted function value or an exports-map index still reaches it. The worst shape this produces is a script that keeps running while its own function quietly stops being called, and every release that adds a builtin name arms it again for older scripts. It was a warning on the theory that a compat shim for an older mix is legitimate authoring; the fleet refuted that — two sites across 785 scripts, neither a shim: one a hand-rolled `ends_with` duplicating the builtin, the other an `fn mix_version()` in a pre-commit hook written to report a *named* interpreter's version and silently answering with the running one's, a live wrong answer that sat behind a warning for sixteen releases. Lint is also the only gate an `ssh_mix` body passes through, and a warning stops nothing by default. The **runtime is unchanged** — the builtin still wins; the fix is to rename. Since 0.91.0 the check also covers the evaluator's inline forms that sit outside the builtin table's dispatch gate — `serve_name`, `printf` and its stdio siblings, and the Bus forms `quit`, `reply`, `subscribe` and the rest — which beat a same-named function just the same: `fn quit() return 1 end; print(quit())` printed `nil` with no diagnostic before. Since 0.92.0 the runtime agrees in operand position too: the binary-operator fast path used to call a user `fn printf` for `printf("B") .. "|"` while a bare `printf("B")` called the builtin; now the builtin wins in both.
- **MIX-W2405** warns when a double-quoted literal contains a backslash escape the lexer does not recognise, so the backslash is kept: `"isn\x27t"` printed `isn\x27t` and nothing said so, which is how a `replace()` wrote that into a committed journal entry. 0.90.0 added `\xHH` (exactly two hex digits), `\0` and `\a \b \f \v`, so what remains is genuinely unrecognised — including `\x` with fewer than two hex digits and `\'`. A deliberate backslash is `\\`, so the warning has a clean escape. An unbraced `\u` is **exempt**: that literal is documented design (it protects embedded JSON and `C:\users`). Single-quoted strings and heredocs keep their own rules and are not scanned.
- **MIX-D3015** and **MIX-W2405** ask how a literal was *spelled*, which the token stream deliberately forgets (`'$sp/x'` and `"$sp/x"` lex to the same token). They therefore need the source text: `mix lint` supplies it, and so does the nested analysis of an `ssh_mix` body, but an embedder calling `analyze()` without setting `AnalyzerConfig::source` simply does not get these two rules.

## `mix explain MIX-XXXX` — the offline diagnostics explainer

Every human-readable lint run that reports anything ends with one trailer line:

```text
explain any code with: mix explain MIX-XXXX
```

`mix explain MIX-W2305` (the `MIX-` prefix is optional, case-insensitive — `mix
explain w2305` works too) prints the code's full story — what it flags, why the
rule exists, the shape it catches, and the fix — from a registry embedded in the
binary, so an agent that hits a code it has never seen gets the whole rationale
in one call without leaving the terminal or reaching the network. An unknown but
code-shaped argument lists the known codes rather than failing blankly; a
non-code argument (`mix explain round`) falls through to the AI builtin
explainer. The registry is the same prose as this page; a build-time test
asserts every code the analyzer can emit has a record, so a new diagnostic
cannot ship without its explanation.

## Machine output

`--json` (D3 schema, `schema_version: 2` since 0.63.0 — the severity
domain gained `"note"` and `summary` gained `notes`; no in-tree consumer
parsed v1, inventoried 2026-09-03):

```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "tool": "mix lint",
  "mix_version": "0.63.0",
  "files": ["worker.mix"],
  "strict_data_files": [],
  "diagnostics": [{
    "code": "MIX-E1101", "severity": "error", "file": "worker.mix",
    "line": 412, "column": null,
    "message": "undefined variable '$DOMAIN' (assigned nowhere in this file)",
    "hint": "assign it, use env(\"DOMAIN\") for environment values, or pass --allow-global DOMAIN"
  }],
  "capabilities": ["fs-read", "network", "process"],
  "summary": {"errors": 1, "warnings": 0, "notes": 0, "denied_warnings": false}
}
```

`--data` emits the same report as strict-data Mix source (parse with
`data_parse`). `line`/`column` are 1-based or `null`. Most diagnostics are
statement-level and carry a `null` column. Lexical and parse errors generally do
carry one — the assignment-chain error, for instance, points at the offending
`&&`/`||`.

`capabilities` is the inventory of capability classes the script's calls
exercise — data, not warnings.
`strict_data_files` lists inputs validated by the strict-data fallback rather
than by the script analyzer.

## Remote bodies — lint sees inside `ssh_mix` (0.69.0)

[`ssh_mix(host, source[, opts])`](remote.md) ships its **second argument** to
a remote `mix -`. That argument is Mix source, and since 0.69.0 lint treats it
as such: when it is a **literal** it is parsed and analysed, and its
diagnostics are reported against the enclosing file with a
`[inside ssh_mix body]` prefix and the line mapped into the outer file.

A literal is a plain string, an all-literal heredoc written inline (the
[headline idiom](remote.md#headline-idiom-ssh_mix--heredoc)), or a variable
whose **sole** binding anywhere in the file is one of those. The last is the
fleet shape: the program bound once, shipped from a loop over hosts.

```mix
$probe = <<END
print(length($base))
END
for $h in $hosts do
  $r = ssh_mix($h, $probe, {bindings: {base: $base}})
end
```

"Sole" is strict. A second assignment, a loop variable or a parameter of the
same name anywhere in the file makes the value unknowable, and the body is
reported as unanalysable instead. The binding must also be visible at the
call: at top level, in the same function, or in an enclosing function reached
through lambdas (a lambda is a closure; a named nested `fn` is not). Findings in a bound heredoc point at the
heredoc's own lines. A heredoc shipped by several calls reports each finding
once. Calls are found at any depth: in loops, branches, functions and lambdas.

```
deploy_thing.mix:283: MIX-D3001 note: [inside ssh_mix body] `regex_match` is
  pattern-first legacy: use `re_match(s, pattern)` (subject first)
```

Before this, a deploy script's entire remote half was one opaque string —
invisible to lint and, more consequentially, to every **inventory built from
lint**. That is not a hypothetical: the `MIX-D3006` inventory that gated
0.68.0's map-binding flip reported *zero* sites for `deploy_vhost.mix`,
locally and on 27/27 fleet nodes, while line 283 of that file is a
two-variable loop over a map living inside such a body.

**A body that cannot be analysed says so** — `MIX-D3012`, for a non-literal
argument (a variable not bound once to a literal, concatenation,
interpolation, `read_file`) or a literal
that does not parse as Mix. This is the rule that matters more than the
analysis: an unreadable body silently counted as clean is precisely how an
inventory reads zero while live sites exist.

A body interpolating `${name}` is reported by name. That splice puts the
**local** value into the remote source text, which is the classic remote bug;
pass the value through `bindings` and write it bare instead.

**Names resolve against the body's own universe.** A remote body is a
separate program. It sees its own binders, the builtins and prelude, and the
names the call injects: the keys of `bindings` and of `env`, both prepended to
the shipped source as assignments. It does **not** see the enclosing file's
functions or variables. So a bare `$base` passed as a binding is clean, while
`$notbound`, or a call to a helper defined only in the outer file, is
`MIX-E1101`/`MIX-E1102` with the body prefix.

The injected names are read from the opts argument when it is a map literal,
or a variable bound **exactly once** to one (`$o = {bindings: {…}}` — the same
sole-definition rule as the body itself, so the fleet opts-variable shape
keeps full checks). When they cannot be read — a call, a concatenation, a
multi-bound name — the boundary is **split, not blanket** (`MIX-D3018` at the
call): dynamic bindings may supply any free DATA variable, so
undefined-**variable** checks stand down (a read one edit away from a name the
body binds still gets the `MIX-D3017` typo note), but a function name cannot
ride in through strict-data bindings, so undefined-**function** checks and
arity checks keep running. The enclosing file keeps all of its own name
checks. Everything else — legacy-name notes,
arity, the truthiness trap — applies normally, and **errors from inside a
body gate exactly as they would anywhere else**.

**Diagnostics map onto the enclosing file's real lines.** `mix lint` reads
the source text, and the lexer records — while decoding each literal — which
physical line every decoded line was written on. So a double-quoted body
whose lines are `\n` ESCAPES reports everything on the one line the literal
physically occupies, a physically multi-line literal and a heredoc map
line-for-line (a `\n` escape inside a heredoc lands on the escape's line,
not an invented one), and a parse/lex error inside a body is mapped by the
error's own inner line.

Which opener a body is paired with is decided by the **parser**, not by
matching text. With the source at hand, lint re-parses the file with
literal-origin recording on: the parser records, in source order, one entry
per literal *expression* it builds, and pairs those entries positionally
with the same tree's literal expressions, verifying variant and decoded
text per pair. Map keys (bare or quoted), `parse` delimiters and `on`
names/doc-strings are not expressions, so identical text there can never
steal a body's opener — a body opened on its own physical line reports
there. If the recording and the tree disagree anywhere, the whole mapping
is refused: a mapping can be missing, but it is never misattached.

An embedder calling `analyze()` without `AnalyzerConfig::source` gets the
documented linear estimate instead (`first_line + N - 1`, exact for the
`$x = ssh_mix($HOST, '` and `$p = <<END` shapes), never invented accuracy.

`ssh_mix` and `ssh_mix_many` carry remote Mix source this way. `run`
accepts shell command text; `run_argv` and `run_pipeline` execute argv
specifications. Lint does not infer embedded source from those process
arguments. `--serve` runs a script file, which lint can inspect directly.

## What lint deliberately does NOT do (v1)

- Straight-line facts do not cross branches, loops, function-call boundaries,
  `source`/`include`, or function frames. This deliberately misses lists and
  builtin-result maps produced indirectly, returned by helpers, assigned in a
  branch, or reached through a dynamic key. Suspicious `nil` coercion into
  paths/hostnames remains out of scope. `MIX-W2302` also stays silent for a
  mixed-return function even when one fallthrough path may still yield `nil`.
  Shell-vs-argv advice remains out of scope — use
  [`validate`](data.md) at boundaries for the nil class today.
- No reachability model for `E1102`/`E1101` beyond the universe rules above.
- Dynamic `require(expr)` paths, extension calls, and Bus dispatch are never hard errors.
