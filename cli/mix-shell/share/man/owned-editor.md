# Owned interactive editor (preview)

Set `MIX_EDITOR=owned` in the environment before starting an interactive Mix
session to select the owned editor. The default remains rustyline. Redirected
input or output uses the existing fallback. Failure to open the owned terminal
writer (including unavailable `/proc/self/fd`) warns and falls back to rustyline.
This preview does not change Mix's
command classification, evaluator, continuation rules or job-control policy.

The evaluator builds the prompt and an owned completion snapshot; one editor
thread owns terminal input, incremental UTF-8 decoding, bracketed paste, editing
state and raw modes. Its `poll()` includes a control socket and a signal wake
socket. Only escape disambiguation uses an input-loop timer. Completion filesystem work runs
off the input thread, with bounded candidates and generation/revision checks.

Enter restores terminal modes and attempts to disable bracketed paste before returning the
line for evaluation. No next prompt starts speculatively. The job controller
continues to own process groups and foreground-terminal transfer. Ctrl+Z at an
editor prompt restores modes before invoking the controller's existing shell
stop behaviour; resume preserves the draft. HUP asks the editor to restore its
protocols before the controller exits.

External SIGTSTP uses the same cooperative cooked-mode stop path. After `bg`,
the editor stays cooked without tty reads until a later SIGCONT finds it in the
foreground. Output uses a separate nonblocking tty description with bounded
writes between control polls. Termios restoration precedes best-effort protocol
cleanup. Pending output and protocol cleanup share a single 250 ms drain deadline;
suspension/shutdown acknowledgement never waits indefinitely for output. This
preserves partial escape sequences and queued finish movement when the tty drains
within the deadline. On expiry or output failure, a tear is accepted and the
terminal emulator may need a reset. Each incomplete cleanup increments the
process-local `OUTPUT_TEARS` diagnostic counter, exposed by control inspection as
`output_tears`; recording it requires no write to the blocked tty.
HUP waits for completed cleanup, including after an input-loop failure.
Registration waits for already-committed default stops before permitting raw
entry, and teardown honours any stop claimed after the input loop ended. The
cooperative-stop flag denotes an editor thread's presence, including cooked
waiting phases. Foreground loss during activation leaves the draft cooked and
waiting for a later continue/foreground wake, rather than failing the session.

The internal generation-tagged protocol supports prompt activation, empty-primary
prompt reservation, resume and shutdown. Admission refuses drafts, continuation,
paste, search and completion. A separate local lifecycle pause preserves drafts
and partial decoder bytes; it grants no evaluation permission. Both paths restore
modes before acknowledgement, and restoration errors never grant terminal use.
Restricted profiles accept only job-management syntax and discard completion and
history supplied for an ordinary prompt. This round does not expose remote
evaluation or provide the parked-evaluator host.

Implemented keys include grapheme-aware left/right/delete/backspace, Home/End,
Ctrl+A/E/B/F, Alt+B/F, history Up/Down and Ctrl+P/N, Ctrl+R reverse search,
Ctrl+K/U/W kill, Ctrl+Y yank, Alt+Y yank-pop, Ctrl+_ undo, Alt+R/Alt+_ redo,
Ctrl+S forward search, Tab completion/cycling, Ctrl+C and
Ctrl+D. Enter leaves search with its selected match; Escape or Ctrl+G restores
the previous draft. Bracketed paste is a single undoable edit; paste payloads
over 64 KiB are rejected after consuming their closing marker, with a one-line
diagnostic on a fresh line and the draft preserved. Prompt bytes are reserved in
the buffer budget so paste cannot exceed the renderer's combined input limit. Input buffers,
snapshots, prompt text and render layouts have explicit limits.

History continues to use `.mix_history` and rustyline's `#V2` multiline encoding,
with the last 100 entries and consecutive duplicate suppression. History files
are loaded with a 16 MiB limit; incomplete, oversized or invalid-UTF-8 loads warn
and permanently refuse saving to that destination for the adapter's lifetime.
Loading a different file, or later successfully loading the same file, cannot
clear that refusal. The original file cannot be overwritten by a loaded prefix.
Completion uses the same variables, aliases,
command names and subcommand sources as the legacy path, plus the captured cwd
and home for paths. Prefix filtering precedes the 4096-result/1 MiB result cap,
including directory enumeration. Command names share a cached owned snapshot
using the legacy PATH-scan lifetime, invalidated when aliases change.
Refreshing PATH commands by filesystem staleness remains declined for this round:
the cache lifetime deliberately matches rustyline.

Prompt SGR colour is retained; cursor-control and terminal-protocol escapes are
stripped. Resize reflows the logical buffer; buffers taller than the terminal
use a viewport containing the cursor. Full editing/search/completion UI parity,
terminal-emulator visual acceptance and real SSH coverage remain promotion gates
before changing the default or removing rustyline.

Per-keystroke O(buffer) reflow is accepted and bounded; optimisation is deferred.
Search Enter selects without submitting; its parity divergence remains deliberate.
An explicit search indicator remains a promotion-gate parity item.
Trailing partial UTF-8 keeps admission Busy until completed under the one-timer rule.
Attachment-backed session generations are deferred to stage D; the current local session tag is 1.

The `owned_editor_pty` integration family covers actual PTY input and handoff,
Unicode editing, multiline history, completion, silent resize, EOF/HUP and nested
shell stop/fg. The legacy job-control family remains an independent regression
gate. No production deployment is part of this preview.

CI and local PTY gates **must** run serially: `openpty` cannot atomically set
CLOEXEC, so concurrent fixture forks could inherit descriptors before duplication
and closure. From the Cargo workspace, run:

```text
cargo test -p mix-shell --test owned_editor_pty -- --test-threads=1
cargo test -p mix-shell --test job_control_pty -- --test-threads=1
```

Apply `--test-threads=1` to broader test invocations which include these binaries
as well. The output gates cover both an undrained master with bounded cleanup and
a partial write drained before the deadline, plus viewport-bounded submission.
