//! Ported from src/desktop/apps/filemgr/src/browser.rs (Bevy/ctk); filemgr
//! stays untouched until retirement. Worker replies (`ListingArrived`,
//! `CountArrived`, `OperationArrived`) replace filemgr's per-inbox `try_recv`
//! types (`ListingReply` browser.rs:309, `DirectoryCountReply` browser.rs:326,
//! `OperationReply` browser.rs:368). The view-facing variants replace the ctk
//! interaction service and Bevy message writers: prompts and confirms are
//! token-keyed (v1 has no OS drag-and-drop, but the reservation state machine
//! is ported now while fresh).
