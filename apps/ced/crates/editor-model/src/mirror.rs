//! The mirror: one [`Text`] (the VIEW = confirmed(rev) + in-flight + queue)
//! with local echo and single-authority OT rebase against the `edit` daemon
//! (ced E1 plan `_plan/2026-09-26-ced-e1-implementation.md` §3 — binding;
//! the rules below are its frozen summary). Pure: no Bus, no clock, no async;
//! every method returns a [`Step`]. Stage S freezes the API; Stage E1d
//! implements it.
//!
//! # Pipeline (§3.3)
//! Only in `Live`. One request in flight per buffer. Queue head is frozen
//! into an immutable [`SentRequest`] with `base_rev = self.rev` and its
//! CURRENT items; otherwise the next queued [`ServerOp`] (undo/redo/save/
//! reload without CAS; `ApplyAt` with its `expect_rev`). Selection publishing
//! never occupies the slot: only when [`Mirror::is_idle`], 200 ms after the
//! last caret move or at the moment the pipeline drains, ≤ 1 per second.
//!
//! # Folding a server edit (§3.4) — frozen check order
//! 1. `ev.rev <= self.rev` → drop (duplicate).
//! 2. `ev.base_rev != self.rev` → `suspect()` and buffer the event.
//! 3. In-flight Local op with `op_id == ev.op_id` → ack (`rev = ev.rev`,
//!    clear, add to `completed`). An `ev.op_id` already acked is a second
//!    commit of that op (every ack leaves `rev` at or past its commit, so a
//!    true duplicate fell to step 1): it folds as remote, with a notice.
//! 4. Everything else folds as REMOTE, transactionally: `ops` = the PRESENT
//!    pending ops (a Doomed / `present == false` in-flight op is EXCLUDED —
//!    codex N1); on clones, for each remote step `x` in order and each op `P`:
//!    `P.items` through `x` with `ThroughFirst` (exactly the server's
//!    `BaseRev` rebase; items keep request order and their own `deleted`), and
//!    `x` through the op's items AS A SET (`ot::transform_through_set`, the
//!    items as they stood before this step) with `SelfFirst` — NOT through
//!    `P.seq()`: the sequential form mis-orders a remote insert at the end of a
//!    deleted range against an insert at its start (Stage S freeze note 3,
//!    fixture 20). `Ok` → apply, commit the clones, `rev =
//!    ev.rev`. `Err(j)` → `revert_suffix(j)` on the UNTOUCHED real state and
//!    loop (the list shrinks; with no ops the fold cannot fail). One
//!    [`Conflict`] per event, accumulated across passes.
//! 5. Own Server ops matched by op_id: caret to the end of the last
//!    transformed inserted span (offset for a pure delete).
//!
//! # Replies (§3.4 table)
//! `rc 0` (full or `reply_truncated`) → `Replied{rev}`; a Local op is acked by
//! its event / history entry / own oversized resync (`resync.rev ==` replied
//! rev and `self.rev == resync.rev - 1`); if `rev <= self.rev` already, ack
//! now. **Server completion barrier**: undo/redo/apply/applied reload clear
//! the slot when the reply is in AND `self.rev >= reply.rev`; save and
//! `unchanged` reload clear on the reply. A late reply whose op_id is in
//! `completed` is a no-op. `CONFLICT` on a Local op → revert from 0;
//! `busy` → resend the IDENTICAL [`SentRequest`] after backoff (250 ms ×2, cap
//! 5 s); other refusals → revert the op and its queue, stash, notice;
//! `epoch_mismatch` → epoch change.
//!
//! # Deadlines (§3.5) — history is read from `wire.sent_at_rev`
//! Local: history has our op_id → committed (fold, ack); absent and the log
//! covers `sent_at_rev+1..` → resend the identical request; trimmed → snapshot
//! with the view in a detached copy. Undo/redo/`ApplyAt`: never resent — found
//! → fold; absent → clear + notice (a late commit folds as remote); trimmed →
//! `suspect()` + notice. Reload: `suspect()`, never resent. Save: `edit.list`
//! check, then one identical resend, then notice.
//!
//! # Recovery (§3.6)
//! Global `event_seq` gap, `resync all`, or the Bus reconnect edge → every
//! Live mirror `suspect()`s: `edit.history {since_rev: rev}` (strictly after),
//! events buffered meanwhile; snapshot fallback on `edits_elided`, trimmed
//! history or a replay mismatch — resolving the in-flight op FIRST (never
//! doomed on a guess), reverting + stashing queued ops, then paging
//! `edit.get snapshot:true`. Epoch change → `Detached{EpochChanged}`.
//!
//! # Conflicts (§3.7)
//! `revert_suffix(j)`: undo ops `j..` in reverse via [`Pending::inverse`]
//! (one `Revert` delta); an in-flight op in the suffix becomes
//! `present = false, Doomed` — refusal expected; `rc 0` = desync → snapshot
//! with a detached copy; deadline → §3.5 Local procedure without resend.

//!
//! # Driving it (E1d)
//! - After EVERY call the host drains [`Mirror::next_outgoing`] (new writes
//!   come only from the scheduler) and [`Mirror::take_retry_timer`] (a busy
//!   backoff to arm; when it fires, [`Mirror::on_retry`]). [`Step::out`]
//!   carries reads (`edit.get`, `edit.history`, `edit.list`) and identical
//!   resends only.
//! - Also after every call: [`Mirror::take_echo_timer`] (an `rc 0` reply is
//!   in but its effect is not — arm a one-shot, then
//!   [`Mirror::on_echo_timeout`], which recovers from history when the echo
//!   was lost with no successor event to reveal the gap) and
//!   [`Mirror::take_outcomes`] (how each queued [`ServerOp`] ended, for the
//!   caller that asked for it).
//! - While a keep-mine transfer runs, only its own stage (or compensating
//!   undo) is sent: local edits and other server ops wait behind it, so they
//!   can neither stale the next stage's `expect_rev` nor be undone by the
//!   compensation.
//! - Every reply, reads included, goes to [`Mirror::on_reply`] with the
//!   [`Outgoing::op_id`] it was sent with; reads carry a mirror-local
//!   `read-<n>` id that is not in the body. A read's deadline re-sends it.
//! - Local ops and server ops leave in the order they were queued (one FIFO
//!   across both), so an undo pressed before more typing undoes only what was
//!   typed before it and never the later typing: §3.3's "drain first",
//!   order-preserving (lead decision, 2026-09-26).
//! - After a snapshot, an in-flight op whose reply rev is past the snapshot
//!   stays in flight with `present == false`; its echo then folds as a remote
//!   edit and acks it. Its items are not in the snapshot's coordinates, so it
//!   is never re-applied optimistically (a sharpening of §3.6 step 4).
//! - History coverage uses editd's `oldest_rev` as it is defined: the rev just
//!   before the first retained entry, so `since` is covered iff
//!   `oldest_rev <= since`.
//! - Epoch change: [`Mirror::epoch_changed`] detaches; the controller opens
//!   the buffer again and calls [`Mirror::reattach`]. Different text → a
//!   [`DetachedCopy`], then [`Mirror::keep_mine`] (one `edit.replace` with
//!   `expect_rev`, or the staged transfer over 1 MiB, cut at the last newline
//!   in the second half of each 1 MiB window, else at a char boundary) or
//!   [`Mirror::take_theirs`].
