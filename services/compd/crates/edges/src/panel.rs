//! Per-edge panel state machine and logical-pixel thickness storage.
//!
//! Ordinary hide and Escape are intentional no-ops while pinned or docked. Corner and
//! pointer containment are independent holds; concealment after either hold is
//! attributed to the event which armed the grace deadline. A deliberate undock from
//! docked hides immediately unless a hold keeps the panel revealed: the grace delay
//! exists to forgive pointer overshoot and never applies to a deliberate action.
//! An interim local menu input suppresses concealment until the popup closes.
//! Hide, Escape, toggle-off or a hidden mode set conceals and, while the
//! pointer is still in the panel or hotspot, latches: hover re-entry cannot re-reveal until the
//! conceal has finished and the pointer is out of the hotspot.
//!
//! Two drivers, one machine. Locally (under any host that does not report
//! the holder plane) corner and pointer
//! membership reveal and the grace deadline conceals, as above. Once the host
//! reports the compositor's holder plane ([`PanelStateMachine::set_holder_plane`])
//! the machine is command-driven: the compositor owns the pointer/focus/popup
//! holders and the conceal delay, and says so with [`PanelInput::HolderReveal`] /
//! [`PanelInput::HolderConceal`]. Corner and pointer inputs then only record
//! membership, no grace deadline is ever armed, and a local hold (menu, resize,
//! intro, explicit show) only defers a conceal until it ends. Deliberate conceals
//! (hide, Escape, a hidden mode) latch against a still-holding compositor until
//! it next reports the holders released, so its verdict cannot undo them.
