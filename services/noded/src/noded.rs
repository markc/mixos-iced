//! Routes Bus messages between local services and bridges to remote

//!
//! Per-peer outbound channels are **bounded** (see `PEER_OUTBOUND_BUFFER`).
//! A slow consumer whose WebSocket cannot drain at publish rate causes
//! subsequent messages to that peer to be dropped rather than buffered
//! without bound — this prevents topic broadcast (Phase A of the topic

/// SPEC 12 §15.5 / C10c BLOCKER — defense-in-depth wire-trust gate.
///
/// Rewrites the `from` header to the broker-authenticated connection
/// identity before the message is forwarded to another service:
///
/// - `Some(peer)`: connection registered via `noded.register`; the
///   wire `from` (whatever the caller put there) is replaced with
///   `peer`. The receiving service can then trust
///   `IncomingCommand.from` as the authenticated identity.
/// - `None`: anonymous connection (no `noded.register`); the `from`
///   header is **removed entirely** rather than rewritten to the
///   synthesised `anon-*` id. Two reasons:
///   1. The receiving service's `PeerIdentity::service_name` is set
///      from `IncomingCommand.from` (e.g. `mixos-maild::bus::mod`'s
///      `dispatch_props`); leaving an `anon-*` string there would
///      look like a registered service to `service_name`-keyed auth
///      policies and to the C10c granter's `target_peer` derivation.
///   2. The right primitive for "give me a not-empty identity for
///      this anonymous connection" is the connection-scoped `anon_id`
///      already used by broker-internal operations
///      (`subscription::synth_anon_id`); rewriting `from` to that
///      would conflate transport identity with application identity.
///
/// Re-serialises `msg` to a fresh wire string so `route_local`'s raw
/// forward and `broadcast_tap`'s observers all see the canonical
/// `from`. The original `text` is returned only when the message
/// already lacked a `from` header and we're in the anonymous case —
/// avoids a redundant round-trip through `to_wire` for the common
/// well-formed-anonymous case.

        //
        // The owning service of a reserved props topic (per
        // `props_reservation::reserved_owner`) uses this to subscribe
        // a third-party peer to a per-namespace slice of its
        // `<svc>.props.records.changed` or `<svc>.props.audit` topic.
        // The lower-level `topic.subscribe` is reservation-gated and
        // rejects every peer; the watch verbs in `Cosmix property-store`
        // call this verb after their own capability re-check so the
        // live-fan-out wire becomes reachable from
        // `<svc>.props.watch` / `<svc>.props.audit.watch`.
        //
        // Auth model — confused-deputy guard:
        //   * Granter identity is the connection-state `peer_id`
        //     (registered service name set by `noded.register`, else
        //     synthesised anon id). NEVER the caller-supplied `from`
        //     header — `from` is the Bus routing field, the registry
        //     gate on `noded.register` is what binds a name to this
        //     specific tx channel.
        //   * `target_peer` is caller-supplied but is only used as a
        //     lookup key into the registry. The actual mpsc::Sender
        //     the broker fans out to is the one the target peer
        //     itself registered. A malicious owner can therefore
        //     cause unsolicited fan-out to *some other registered
        //     service* (DoS on target), but cannot impersonate the
        //     target or read their traffic. The scope of damage is
        //     bounded to the owner's own reserved topics.
        //   * Anonymous peers can't be `target_peer` — they aren't
        //     in the registry (no `noded.register`), so the lookup
        //     fails with `target_peer_not_connected` (rev-2 Q4).
