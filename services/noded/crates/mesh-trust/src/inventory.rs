//! SPEC 13 §7.1/§7.2 signed mesh inventory — types + verification.
//!
//! The mesh inventory is the **trust root** (INV-1): the single
//! authored document declaring mesh membership + identity. Phase 1a
//! authored it *unsigned* (a generator input); Phase 1b wraps it in a
//! detached-signature envelope so a node can boot and route from its
//! locally-cached *verified* authority, never a runtime dependency on
//! the hub (INV-7).
//!
//! This module is the **verifier half** (SPEC 13 1b-a). It carries no
//! mesh-private data and no IO/async — pure crypto + types — so it
//! lives in the crate *core* (`--no-default-features`). The Rust signer
//! (1b-b) and `noded`'s load/enforce path (1b-c) build on it; both
//! signer and verifier reach the same signature bytes by both calling
//! the one shared [`crate::canonical`] canonicaliser (the cardinal
//! anti-divergence mitigation, SPEC 13 §6).
//!
//! # Envelope shape (§7.1)
//!
//! ```text
//! signed-inventory = {
//!   payload    = { schema_version, canonical_encoding, mesh, subnet,
//!                  epoch, signed_at, valid_until, hub[], verify_keys[],
//!                  members[], (recovery, recovery_generation) },
//!   signatures = [ { key_id, alg, sig } ]   -- ≥1, DISTINCT key_ids
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The signature is **outside** the bytes it signs — a classic foot-gun
//! is signing a struct that contains its own signature. Each signature
//! is over `canonical_encoding(payload)`.
//!
//! # What [`SignedInventory::verify`] enforces
//!
//! - **`canonical_encoding` validated against a closed set FIRST**
//!   (§7.2) — before canonicalising — so the self-described field cannot
//!   pick an attacker-favourable encoding.
//! - **Algorithm pinned to Ed25519** (§7.2): only an `Ed25519` signature
//!   `alg` can count toward acceptance (no `alg:none`, no downgrade); a
//!   `verify_keys` `key_type` other than `Ed25519` is rejected.
//! - **At least one signature** by a `key_id` that is both **declared in
//!   `payload.verify_keys`** (§7.1) and **already trusted** by the node
//!   (active|retiring) must verify over the re-canonicalised bytes —
//!   verified against the *trusted* public key, never the payload-claimed
//!   one (§7.2). A signature naming a key the node does not yet trust is
//!   skipped, which is exactly what lets a node trusting only the old key
//!   accept a dual-signed rotation inventory and learn the new verify key
//!   in-band (§6.4).
//! - **Signatures are attacker-malleable.** They sit *outside* the signed
//!   bytes, so a hostile carrier can append, duplicate, or corrupt
//!   `signatures[]` entries without breaking the payload signature. Every
//!   invalid/unrecognised entry is therefore **skipped, never a hard
//!   reject** (hard-rejecting on one appended junk entry would be a
//!   trivial denial-of-update); each `key_id` is counted at most once (no
//!   dup-sig fake quorum). `verify_keys[]` (which IS signed) must instead
//!   have distinct `key_id`s.
//! - **Epoch monotonicity** (§7.2): a normal inventory whose `epoch` is
//!   *older* than the node's cached epoch is rejected even if the
//!   signature verifies (rollback protection).
//! - **Normal generation carriage** (§6.4): a generation-silent normal
//!   inventory is accepted as generation zero only while the cached recovery
//!   generation is zero (the migration window). Once the cached generation is
//!   above zero it is rejected as [`VerifyError::NormalMissingRecoveryGeneration`]
//!   regardless of its epoch. The `recovery` key is presence-marked: normal
//!   payloads omit it, and an explicit `recovery:false` is rejected.
//! - **In-band verify-key adoption** (§7.2/§6.4): on accept the caller
//!   adopts `payload.verify_keys` as its new trusted set ([`AcceptedInventory::adopt_verify_keys`]).
//! - **Genesis anti-lockout rule 1** (§7.2): the adopted `verify_keys`
//!   set MUST still contain the genesis key — unconditionally.
//! - **Recovery override** (§6.4): a `recovery: true` payload signed by
//!   the **genesis** key, carrying a `recovery_generation` greater than
//!   the node's last, supersedes the epoch axis — the one sanctioned bypass
//!   of rollback protection. An older generation cannot replay; an equal
//!   generation is accepted only when its canonical hash exactly matches the
//!   pinned payload. Legacy hashless migration is normal-path only.
//! - **The recovery floor only rises under genesis.** A normal inventory
//!   may *echo* the current `recovery_generation`, but it may only
//!   *raise* the floor when genesis-signed (and never roll it back) — so
//!   a stolen *active* key cannot pin the floor at `u64::MAX` and
//!   permanently lock out genesis recovery (§6.4).
//!
//! # Deliberate non-goals of this slice
//!
//! - **No wall-clock gating.** The mesh has no trusted time source
//!   (§16a); `signed_at` / `valid_until` are advisory only and are NOT
//!   consulted here. The security trigger is epoch/generation-driven.
//! - **Anti-lockout rule 2** (a `retiring` key must not be the *sole*
//!   authoriser of a payload that adds/promotes a `verify_keys` entry,
//!   §7.2) is **not** enforced in 1b-a — the testbed runs a single
//!   signing key (B2) with no `retiring` key, and the promote-detection
//!   logic lands with the multi-key rotation slice. Tracked, not
//!   forgotten.
//! - **No member-record interpretation.** Admission/routing off the
//!   member set is Phase 2 / 1b-c; here `members` is carried as opaque
//!   (but strictly-parsed, dup-key-rejecting) signed data.
//! - **No persistence.** The `(epoch, recovery_generation)` baseline is
//!   an *input* ([`NodeTrustState`]); durable storage is 1b-c.
